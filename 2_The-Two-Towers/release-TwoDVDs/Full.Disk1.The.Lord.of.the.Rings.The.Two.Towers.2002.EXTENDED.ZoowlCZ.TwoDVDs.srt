4
00:01:16,857 --> 00:01:20,588
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!

5
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:28,051
I am a servant of the Secret
Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.

6
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:38,759
Go back to the Shadow.

7
00:01:39,665 --> 00:01:43,465
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!

8
00:01:47,338 --> 00:01:51,832
You shall not pass!

9
00:02:19,003 --> 00:02:20,664
No! No!

10
00:02:20,872 --> 00:02:22,840
Gandalf!

11
00:02:30,447 --> 00:02:32,176
Fly, you fools.

12
00:02:32,816 --> 00:02:34,681
No!

13
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:38,712
Gandalf!

14
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:49,220
Gandalf!

15
00:03:50,225 --> 00:03:52,454
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

16
00:03:54,395 --> 00:03:56,124
Nothing.

17
00:04:03,404 --> 00:04:05,463
Just a dream.

18
00:04:18,652 --> 00:04:19,846
Can you see the bottom?

19
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:24,249
No! Don't look down, Sam! Just keep going!

20
00:04:35,102 --> 00:04:37,229
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!

21
00:04:40,341 --> 00:04:42,309
Mr. Frodo!

22
00:04:44,912 --> 00:04:46,641
I think I've found the bottom.

23
00:04:52,051 --> 00:04:55,043
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.

24
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:58,451
It's not natural. None of it.

25
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,619
- What's in this?
- Nothing.

26
00:05:04,997 --> 00:05:06,055
Just a bit of seasoning.

27
00:05:06,665 --> 00:05:09,463
I thought maybe if we was having a
roast chicken one night or something.

28
00:05:10,002 --> 00:05:12,232
Roast chicken?!

29
00:05:12,838 --> 00:05:14,100
You never know.

30
00:05:14,573 --> 00:05:17,508
Sam. My dear Sam.

31
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:23,147
It's very special, that. It's
the best salt in all the Shire.

32
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,407
It is special.

33
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,188
It's a little bit of home.

34
00:05:35,494 --> 00:05:37,928
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.

35
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,888
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?

36
00:05:42,734 --> 00:05:46,568
It's a shame, really. Lady Galadriel gave me that.

37
00:05:47,272 --> 00:05:49,206
Real Elvish rope.

38
00:05:50,075 --> 00:05:52,509
Well, there's nothing for it. It's one of my knots.

39
00:05:52,677 --> 00:05:54,645
Won't come free in a hurry.

40
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,647
Real Elvish rope.

41
00:06:19,803 --> 00:06:24,297
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.

42
00:06:24,474 --> 00:06:26,669
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.

43
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,173
It's just where we can't get.

44
00:06:30,647 --> 00:06:33,582
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

45
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,683
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.

46
00:06:40,323 --> 00:06:43,622
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam...

47
00:06:44,494 --> 00:06:45,961
...but they did.

48
00:06:59,075 --> 00:07:00,007
Mr. Frodo?

49
00:07:03,946 --> 00:07:05,345
It's the Ring, isn't it?

50
00:07:06,448 --> 00:07:08,916
It's getting heavier.

51
00:07:21,562 --> 00:07:24,292
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.

52
00:07:25,032 --> 00:07:27,091
Oh, yes. Lovely.

53
00:07:27,268 --> 00:07:30,032
Lembas bread. And look!

54
00:07:32,473 --> 00:07:34,737
More lembas bread.

55
00:07:45,486 --> 00:07:47,454
I don't usually hold with foreign food...

56
00:07:47,655 --> 00:07:50,647
...but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

57
00:07:51,526 --> 00:07:54,984
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?

58
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:03,099
Those rain clouds might.

59
00:08:37,403 --> 00:08:40,167
This looks strangely familiar.

60
00:08:40,739 --> 00:08:43,264
It's because we've been here before.

61
00:08:43,442 --> 00:08:46,002
We're going in circles.

62
00:08:46,745 --> 00:08:48,610
What is that horrid stink?

63
00:08:48,781 --> 00:08:50,976
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

64
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,084
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.

65
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,350
I can smell it.

66
00:09:00,593 --> 00:09:03,027
We're not alone.

67
00:09:16,674 --> 00:09:20,770
The thieves. The thieves.

68
00:09:20,945 --> 00:09:24,904
The filthy little thieves.

69
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,744
Where is it?

70
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:30,615
Where is it?

71
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:34,519
They stole it from us.

72
00:09:34,726 --> 00:09:38,923
My precious.

73
00:09:39,796 --> 00:09:43,061
Curse them, we hates them!

74
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:47,329
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

75
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:44,222
This is Sting.

76
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:45,917
You've seen it before...

77
00:10:46,128 --> 00:10:48,595
haven't you, Gollum?

78
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:56,159
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

79
00:11:12,187 --> 00:11:13,949
It burns!

80
00:11:14,154 --> 00:11:16,452
It burns us!

81
00:11:17,925 --> 00:11:19,392
It freezes!

82
00:11:21,195 --> 00:11:23,459
Nasty Elves twisted it.

83
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,292
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!

84
00:11:29,703 --> 00:11:33,969
It's hopeless. Every Orc in
Mordor's going to hear this racket.

85
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:36,735
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!

86
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:40,502
That would kill us! Kill us!

87
00:11:40,681 --> 00:11:43,377
It's no more than you deserve!

88
00:11:45,085 --> 00:11:47,110
Maybe he does deserve to die.

89
00:11:49,523 --> 00:11:52,959
But now that I see him, I do pity him.

90
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:01,264
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.

91
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:04,265
Take it off us.

92
00:12:07,373 --> 00:12:11,309
We swears to do what you wants.

93
00:12:11,477 --> 00:12:13,411
We swears.

94
00:12:13,713 --> 00:12:16,147
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.

95
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,579
We swears...

96
00:12:20,852 --> 00:12:25,585
to serve the master of the precious.

97
00:12:27,225 --> 00:12:29,557
We will swear on...

98
00:12:29,728 --> 00:12:31,696
on the precious.

99
00:12:31,863 --> 00:12:34,058
Gollum. Gollum.

100
00:12:34,232 --> 00:12:38,362
The Ring is treacherous. It will hold you to your word.

101
00:12:39,204 --> 00:12:40,535
Yes...

102
00:12:41,106 --> 00:12:43,597
on the precious.

103
00:12:45,977 --> 00:12:48,411
On the precious.

104
00:12:49,581 --> 00:12:51,071
I don't believe you!

105
00:12:53,118 --> 00:12:56,576
- Get down! I said, down!
- Sam!

106
00:12:56,822 --> 00:12:58,517
He's trying to trick us.

107
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,682
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.

108
00:13:13,103 --> 00:13:17,631
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.

109
00:13:20,577 --> 00:13:22,306
You've been there before?

110
00:13:23,313 --> 00:13:24,905
Yes.

111
00:13:35,825 --> 00:13:38,453
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

112
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:50,904
To the Gate, to the Gate! To
the Gate, the master says. Yes!

113
00:13:51,074 --> 00:13:55,875
No! We won't go back. Not there. Not to him.

114
00:13:56,045 --> 00:14:00,277
They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!

115
00:14:00,483 --> 00:14:03,919
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.

116
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:10,081
No. Ashes and dust and thirst
there is, and pits, pits, pits.

117
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,127
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.

118
00:14:13,296 --> 00:14:18,427
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.

119
00:14:21,404 --> 00:14:25,202
Hey! Come back now! Come back!

120
00:14:27,608 --> 00:14:29,838
There! What did I tell you?

121
00:14:30,011 --> 00:14:32,241
He's run off, the old villain.

122
00:14:32,446 --> 00:14:34,937
So much for his promises.

123
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:36,707
This way, Hobbits.

124
00:14:36,984 --> 00:14:39,009
Follow me!

125
00:14:52,867 --> 00:14:54,266
Merry!

126
00:14:55,236 --> 00:14:56,726
Merry!

127
00:15:02,243 --> 00:15:06,009
You're late. Our master grows impatient.

128
00:15:06,213 --> 00:15:08,010
He wants the Shire-rats now.

129
00:15:08,883 --> 00:15:13,479
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.

130
00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:17,582
Saruman will have his prize.

131
00:15:17,758 --> 00:15:20,955
We will deliver them.

132
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:28,532
Merry!

133
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:31,032
Merry? Wake up.

134
00:15:34,507 --> 00:15:36,371
My friend is sick.

135
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:39,471
He needs water. Please!

136
00:15:40,245 --> 00:15:44,181
Sick, is he? Give him some medicine, boys!

137
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:49,080
Stop it!

138
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,918
Can't take his draught!

139
00:15:56,595 --> 00:15:59,155
- Leave him alone!
- Why?

140
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:02,064
You want some?

141
00:16:02,801 --> 00:16:06,168
Then keep your mouth shut.

142
00:16:09,575 --> 00:16:11,600
Merry.

143
00:16:12,511 --> 00:16:14,001
Hello, Pip.

144
00:16:15,848 --> 00:16:18,282
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.

145
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,941
- It was just an act.
- An act?

146
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,487
See? I fooled you too.

147
00:16:27,192 --> 00:16:28,921
Don't worry about me, Pippin.

148
00:16:31,229 --> 00:16:33,220
What is it? What do you smell?

149
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:35,495
Man-flesh.

150
00:16:37,635 --> 00:16:40,001
They've picked up our trail.

151
00:16:41,105 --> 00:16:42,231
Aragorn.

152
00:16:43,941 --> 00:16:45,772
Let's move!

153
00:17:09,332 --> 00:17:11,857
Their pace has quickened.

154
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:14,837
They must have caught our scent.

155
00:17:15,005 --> 00:17:16,768
Hurry!

156
00:17:20,444 --> 00:17:22,173
Come on, Gimli!

157
00:17:26,016 --> 00:17:28,314
Three days and nights pursuit.

158
00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:31,454
No food. No rest.

159
00:17:31,621 --> 00:17:35,613
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.

160
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:10,218
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.

161
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:13,925
They may yet be alive.

162
00:18:14,763 --> 00:18:17,391
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

163
00:18:20,001 --> 00:18:22,492
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!

164
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:26,970
I'm wasted on cross-country. We
Dwarves are natural sprinters.

165
00:18:27,509 --> 00:18:30,774
Very dangerous over short distances.

166
00:18:42,523 --> 00:18:44,252
Rohan.

167
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:47,222
Home of the Horse-lords.

168
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:50,988
There's something strange at work here.

169
00:18:51,165 --> 00:18:54,134
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.

170
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:57,270
Sets its will against us.

171
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:05,343
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?

172
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:08,072
The Uruks turn northeast.

173
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,076
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.

174
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:13,213
Saruman.

175
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,824
The world is changing.

176
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:30,594
Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of Isengard...

177
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:34,034
and Mordor?

178
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:41,372
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman...

179
00:19:41,546 --> 00:19:45,175
and the union of the two towers?

180
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,659
Together, my Lord Sauron...

181
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:58,353
we shall rule this Middle-earth.

182
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:18,712
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.

183
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:22,548
The forests will fall.

184
00:20:24,455 --> 00:20:27,322
A new order will rise.

185
00:20:28,392 --> 00:20:33,295
We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear...

186
00:20:33,464 --> 00:20:37,423
and the iron fists of the Orc.

187
00:20:49,946 --> 00:20:53,177
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!

188
00:20:53,349 --> 00:20:54,976
But, my lord, there are too many!

189
00:20:55,151 --> 00:20:58,177
They cannot all be armed in
time, we don't have the means.

190
00:20:58,354 --> 00:21:01,414
Build a dam, block the stream,
work the furnaces night and day.

191
00:21:02,058 --> 00:21:04,424
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.

192
00:21:05,795 --> 00:21:10,061
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.

193
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:13,833
- Burn it.
- Yes.

194
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,868
We will fight for you.

195
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,008
Swear it.

196
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:34,285
We will die for Saruman.

197
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,381
The Horse-Men took your lands.

198
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:42,087
They drove your people into the
hills to scratch a living off rocks.

199
00:21:42,264 --> 00:21:43,697
Murderers!

200
00:21:44,633 --> 00:21:46,725
Take back the lands they stole from you.

201
00:21:46,934 --> 00:21:48,697
Burn every village!

202
00:21:51,939 --> 00:21:57,070
We have only to remove those who oppose us.

203
00:21:57,545 --> 00:22:00,070
It will begin in Rohan.

204
00:22:00,815 --> 00:22:04,342
Too long have these peasants stood against you.

205
00:22:04,518 --> 00:22:06,315
But no more.

206
00:22:06,487 --> 00:22:08,751
Eothain! Eothain!

207
00:22:10,925 --> 00:22:13,587
You take your sister. You'll go faster with just two.

208
00:22:13,961 --> 00:22:16,623
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.

209
00:22:16,797 --> 00:22:18,458
He is too big for him.

210
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:21,635
Listen to me. You must ride
to Edoras and raise the alarm.

211
00:22:21,836 --> 00:22:24,327
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.

212
00:22:24,638 --> 00:22:27,539
I don't want to leave. I don't want to go, Mama.

213
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:31,439
Freda, I will find you there.

214
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,045
Quickly!

215
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:46,015
Go, child.

216
00:22:58,904 --> 00:23:00,804
Rohan, my lord...

217
00:23:01,273 --> 00:23:04,003
is ready to fall.

218
00:23:15,254 --> 00:23:16,778
Theodred.

219
00:23:16,989 --> 00:23:18,616
Find the king's son!

220
00:23:35,074 --> 00:23:41,104
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.

221
00:23:42,014 --> 00:23:44,847
My Lord Eomer, over here!

222
00:23:53,658 --> 00:23:55,455
He's alive.

223
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,349
Theodred.

224
00:24:41,738 --> 00:24:44,764
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

225
00:24:45,175 --> 00:24:47,666
He was ambushed by Orcs.

226
00:24:49,212 --> 00:24:52,841
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.

227
00:24:53,216 --> 00:24:55,706
That is a lie.

228
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,721
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.

229
00:25:04,393 --> 00:25:06,384
Grima.

230
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,763
Grima.

231
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,790
Grima.

232
00:25:14,602 --> 00:25:17,662
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.

233
00:25:18,072 --> 00:25:21,667
Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at will.

234
00:25:22,343 --> 00:25:25,244
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.

235
00:25:33,087 --> 00:25:38,855
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

236
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,528
Can you not see?

237
00:25:41,696 --> 00:25:46,724
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent...

238
00:25:46,935 --> 00:25:49,460
your warmongering.

239
00:25:51,673 --> 00:25:53,641
Warmongering?

240
00:25:53,808 --> 00:25:55,969
How long is it since Saruman bought you?

241
00:25:56,811 --> 00:25:59,176
What was the promised price, Grima?

242
00:25:59,413 --> 00:26:03,008
When all the Men are dead, you will
take your share of the treasure?

243
00:26:15,495 --> 00:26:18,123
Too long have you watched my sister.

244
00:26:18,332 --> 00:26:20,300
Too long have you haunted her steps.

245
00:26:28,374 --> 00:26:32,708
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.

246
00:26:32,878 --> 00:26:34,038
Too much.

247
00:26:36,382 --> 00:26:41,183
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan...

248
00:26:41,354 --> 00:26:46,155
and all its domains under pain of death.

249
00:26:46,626 --> 00:26:48,958
You have no authority here.

250
00:26:49,128 --> 00:26:51,596
Your orders mean nothing.

251
00:26:52,131 --> 00:26:55,965
This order does not come from me.

252
00:26:56,135 --> 00:26:58,296
It comes from the king.

253
00:26:58,904 --> 00:27:01,497
He signed it this morning.

254
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,766
Keep breathing. That's the key.

255
00:27:36,006 --> 00:27:37,701
Breathe.

256
00:27:41,812 --> 00:27:45,646
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

257
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,824
We're not going no further...

258
00:28:04,001 --> 00:28:05,991
until we've had a breather.

259
00:28:06,536 --> 00:28:08,504
Get a fire going!

260
00:28:12,575 --> 00:28:14,133
Merry!

261
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,841
Merry!

262
00:28:17,547 --> 00:28:22,746
I think we might have made a
mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.

263
00:28:32,228 --> 00:28:34,423
What's making that noise?

264
00:28:35,998 --> 00:28:37,465
It's the trees.

265
00:28:38,201 --> 00:28:39,259
What?

266
00:28:39,602 --> 00:28:43,436
You remember the Old Forest,
on the borders of Buckland?

267
00:28:43,606 --> 00:28:48,099
Folk used to say there was something in
the water that made the trees grow tall...

268
00:28:48,276 --> 00:28:49,800
and come alive.

269
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:51,740
Alive?

270
00:28:52,614 --> 00:28:54,309
Trees that could whisper...

271
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:57,785
talk to each other...

272
00:28:57,953 --> 00:28:59,750
even move.

273
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,620
I'm starving.

274
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:07,852
We ain't had nothing but maggoty
bread for three stinking days.

275
00:29:08,229 --> 00:29:09,491
Yeah!

276
00:29:09,697 --> 00:29:12,962
Why can't we have some meat?!

277
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:17,531
What about them?

278
00:29:17,705 --> 00:29:19,605
They're fresh.

279
00:29:20,274 --> 00:29:24,040
They are not for eating.

280
00:29:30,017 --> 00:29:31,985
What about their legs?

281
00:29:32,186 --> 00:29:34,484
They don't need those.

282
00:29:35,956 --> 00:29:39,153
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!

283
00:29:40,961 --> 00:29:45,864
The prisoners go to Saruman. Alive and unspoiled.

284
00:29:46,233 --> 00:29:48,167
Alive?

285
00:29:51,138 --> 00:29:55,404
Why alive? Do they give good sport?

286
00:29:57,811 --> 00:30:01,178
They have something. An Elvish weapon.

287
00:30:01,347 --> 00:30:04,373
The master wants it for the war.

288
00:30:07,287 --> 00:30:09,152
They think we have the Ring.

289
00:30:09,322 --> 00:30:11,755
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.

290
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:15,593
Just a mouthful...

291
00:30:15,761 --> 00:30:16,955
a bit of the flank.

292
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:27,330
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.

293
00:30:33,946 --> 00:30:35,208
Pippin.

294
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,075
Let's go.

295
00:30:45,524 --> 00:30:47,014
Go on.

296
00:30:47,226 --> 00:30:48,693
Call for help.

297
00:30:50,095 --> 00:30:51,187
Squeal.

298
00:30:51,396 --> 00:30:54,559
No one's going to save you now.

299
00:31:03,742 --> 00:31:05,141
Pippin!

300
00:31:29,432 --> 00:31:31,923
A red sun rises.

301
00:31:32,435 --> 00:31:35,370
Blood has been spilled this night.

302
00:32:06,536 --> 00:32:08,401
Riders of Rohan...

303
00:32:08,838 --> 00:32:11,272
what news from the Mark?

304
00:32:39,033 --> 00:32:43,436
What business does an Elf, a Man
and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?

305
00:32:44,238 --> 00:32:45,500
Speak quickly!

306
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,504
Give me your name, horse-master,
and I shall give you mine.

307
00:32:59,654 --> 00:33:02,179
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...

308
00:33:02,624 --> 00:33:04,990
if it stood but a little higher from the ground.

309
00:33:06,027 --> 00:33:08,086
You would die before your stroke fell.

310
00:33:16,804 --> 00:33:18,704
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

311
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,237
This is Gimli, son of Gloin, and
Legolas of the Woodland Realm.

312
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:26,641
We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king.

313
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:32,147
Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.

314
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,580
Not even his own kin.

315
00:33:39,091 --> 00:33:41,059
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king...

316
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,161
and claimed lordship over these lands.

317
00:33:45,131 --> 00:33:48,123
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

318
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,063
And for that, we are banished.

319
00:33:52,138 --> 00:33:55,437
The White Wizard is cunning.

320
00:33:56,108 --> 00:33:58,508
He walks here and there, they say...

321
00:33:58,711 --> 00:34:00,645
as an old man hooded and cloaked.

322
00:34:02,581 --> 00:34:06,347
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.

323
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:08,749
We are no spies.

324
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:11,856
We track a party of Uruk-hai
westward across the plain.

325
00:34:12,158 --> 00:34:14,490
They have taken two of our friends captive.

326
00:34:15,294 --> 00:34:17,762
The Uruks are destroyed. We
slaughtered them during the night.

327
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:21,093
But there were two Hobbits. Did
you see two Hobbits with them?

328
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:24,235
They would be small. Only children to your eyes.

329
00:34:27,572 --> 00:34:29,563
We left none alive.

330
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:33,177
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

331
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:39,878
Dead?

332
00:34:42,887 --> 00:34:44,581
I am sorry.

333
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,458
Hasufel! Arod!

334
00:34:54,264 --> 00:34:58,928
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

335
00:35:00,137 --> 00:35:01,729
Farewell.

336
00:35:06,944 --> 00:35:09,174
Look for your friends.

337
00:35:09,646 --> 00:35:11,876
But do not trust to hope.

338
00:35:13,584 --> 00:35:16,144
It has forsaken these lands.

339
00:35:16,353 --> 00:35:18,344
We ride north!

340
00:36:08,937 --> 00:36:10,768
It's one of their wee belts.

341
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:16,220
[Sindarin] <i>Hiro hyn hîdh ab ’wanath.</i>
[English] May they find peace after death.

342
00:36:24,586 --> 00:36:26,611
We failed them.

343
00:36:40,668 --> 00:36:42,829
A Hobbit lay here.

344
00:36:44,738 --> 00:36:46,365
And the other.

345
00:36:57,184 --> 00:36:58,776
They crawled.

346
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,983
Their hands were bound.

347
00:37:17,136 --> 00:37:18,967
Their bonds were cut.

348
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:36,580
They ran over here.

349
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:41,419
They were followed.

350
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,359
The belt!

351
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:51,395
Run!

352
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,471
Tracks lead away from the battle...

353
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,373
into Fangorn Forest.

354
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:05,716
Fangorn?

355
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:08,512
What madness drove them in there?

356
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:29,262
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

357
00:38:35,979 --> 00:38:39,415
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!

358
00:38:45,655 --> 00:38:46,644
Come here!

359
00:38:52,162 --> 00:38:54,722
Trees. Climb a tree.

360
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,769
He's gone.

361
00:39:17,854 --> 00:39:20,186
Merry!

362
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:36,070
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

363
00:39:43,177 --> 00:39:44,735
Run, Merry!

364
00:39:54,522 --> 00:39:58,856
Little Orcs.

365
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:01,359
It's talking, Merry. The tree is talking.

366
00:40:01,529 --> 00:40:03,429
Tree?

367
00:40:03,598 --> 00:40:06,590
I am no tree!

368
00:40:06,834 --> 00:40:08,995
I am an Ent.

369
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:11,697
A tree-herder.

370
00:40:12,273 --> 00:40:14,241
A shepherd of the forest.

371
00:40:14,409 --> 00:40:15,774
Don't talk to it, Merry.

372
00:40:16,277 --> 00:40:17,744
Don't encourage it!

373
00:40:17,945 --> 00:40:22,177
Treebeard, some call me.

374
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,318
And whose side are you on?

375
00:40:24,919 --> 00:40:26,546
Side?

376
00:40:26,754 --> 00:40:29,621
I am on nobody's side...

377
00:40:29,991 --> 00:40:35,327
because nobody's on my side, little Orc.

378
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:40,760
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

379
00:40:41,169 --> 00:40:43,567
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!

380
00:40:43,736 --> 00:40:46,034
Hobbits?

381
00:40:47,273 --> 00:40:52,142
Never heard of a Hobbit before.

382
00:40:53,345 --> 00:40:57,839
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!

383
00:40:58,017 --> 00:41:00,144
They come with fire.

384
00:41:00,352 --> 00:41:02,912
They come with axes.

385
00:41:03,122 --> 00:41:07,923
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!

386
00:41:08,127 --> 00:41:11,927
- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
- No!

387
00:41:12,164 --> 00:41:14,997
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!

388
00:41:15,201 --> 00:41:16,998
Halflings!

389
00:41:17,169 --> 00:41:18,261
Shire-folk!

390
00:41:18,471 --> 00:41:20,803
Maybe you are...

391
00:41:21,107 --> 00:41:24,736
and maybe you aren't.

392
00:41:25,845 --> 00:41:29,747
The White Wizard will know.

393
00:41:30,549 --> 00:41:32,483
The White Wizard?

394
00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:35,509
Saruman.

395
00:41:48,099 --> 00:41:49,760
See? See?

396
00:41:50,001 --> 00:41:52,401
We've led you out.

397
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:55,060
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!

398
00:41:58,175 --> 00:42:00,643
Very lucky we find you.

399
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:09,046
Nice Hobbit.

400
00:42:11,955 --> 00:42:15,220
It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

401
00:42:15,392 --> 00:42:18,020
A swamp, yes, yes.

402
00:42:18,795 --> 00:42:23,494
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

403
00:42:25,836 --> 00:42:29,272
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

404
00:42:32,543 --> 00:42:35,171
I found it. I did.

405
00:42:35,379 --> 00:42:38,041
The way through the marshes.

406
00:42:38,248 --> 00:42:41,740
Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't know it.

407
00:42:41,952 --> 00:42:46,013
They go around for miles and miles.

408
00:42:46,223 --> 00:42:47,656
Come quickly.

409
00:42:47,858 --> 00:42:51,918
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

410
00:42:53,095 --> 00:42:56,428
I hate this place. It's too quiet.

411
00:42:56,599 --> 00:42:58,863
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.

412
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:02,402
No, no birdses to eat.

413
00:43:02,638 --> 00:43:06,869
No crunchable birdses.

414
00:43:07,475 --> 00:43:10,342
We are famished! Yes!

415
00:43:10,512 --> 00:43:14,812
Famished we are, precious!

416
00:43:29,764 --> 00:43:31,288
Here.

417
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,491
What does it eats?

418
00:43:34,703 --> 00:43:36,671
Is it tasty?

419
00:43:41,977 --> 00:43:44,571
It tries to chokes us!

420
00:43:44,846 --> 00:43:48,509
We can't eats Hobbit food!

421
00:43:50,218 --> 00:43:54,244
We must starve!

422
00:43:54,421 --> 00:43:56,787
Well, starve, then. And good riddance!

423
00:43:57,558 --> 00:43:59,753
Oh, cruel Hobbit.

424
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,793
It does not care if we be hungry.

425
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:07,763
Does not care if we should die.

426
00:44:08,402 --> 00:44:11,235
Not like master.

427
00:44:12,606 --> 00:44:14,699
Master cares.

428
00:44:15,876 --> 00:44:17,740
Master knows.

429
00:44:20,213 --> 00:44:22,181
Yes.

430
00:44:22,348 --> 00:44:24,976
Precious.

431
00:44:28,554 --> 00:44:32,183
Once it takes hold of us...

432
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:38,224
it never lets go.

433
00:44:38,931 --> 00:44:40,091
Don't touch me!

434
00:45:12,564 --> 00:45:14,429
There are dead things!

435
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:16,362
Dead faces in the water.

436
00:45:21,206 --> 00:45:25,165
All dead. All rotten.

437
00:45:25,677 --> 00:45:29,442
Elves and Men and Orcses.

438
00:45:29,647 --> 00:45:33,276
A great battle long ago.

439
00:45:34,085 --> 00:45:35,814
Dead Marshes.

440
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:38,750
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

441
00:45:40,458 --> 00:45:42,187
This way.

442
00:45:42,393 --> 00:45:45,157
Don't follow the lights.

443
00:45:46,897 --> 00:45:50,765
Careful now! Or Hobbits go
down to join the dead ones...

444
00:45:50,968 --> 00:45:55,064
and light little candles of their own.

445
00:46:21,264 --> 00:46:22,731
Frodo!

446
00:47:07,208 --> 00:47:11,872
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.

447
00:47:12,046 --> 00:47:13,911
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!

448
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,946
Are you all right?

449
00:47:44,846 --> 00:47:47,815
So bright.

450
00:47:48,015 --> 00:47:51,815
So beautiful.

451
00:47:51,986 --> 00:47:55,853
Our precious.

452
00:47:57,324 --> 00:47:58,814
What did you say?

453
00:47:59,025 --> 00:48:01,186
Master should be resting.

454
00:48:01,361 --> 00:48:05,421
Master needs to keep up his strength.

455
00:48:07,399 --> 00:48:10,664
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

456
00:48:10,836 --> 00:48:12,326
Gollum. Gollum.

457
00:48:12,505 --> 00:48:14,302
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.

458
00:48:14,473 --> 00:48:18,569
Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home

459
00:48:18,744 --> 00:48:20,302
He said your life was a sad story.

460
00:48:20,513 --> 00:48:25,041
They do not see what lies ahead
When sun has failed and moon is dead

461
00:48:25,217 --> 00:48:28,209
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.

462
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:30,149
Were you?

463
00:48:32,391 --> 00:48:34,621
Smeagol.

464
00:48:39,331 --> 00:48:41,856
What did you call me?

465
00:48:43,202 --> 00:48:45,966
That was your name once, wasn't it?

466
00:48:46,539 --> 00:48:48,905
A long time ago.

467
00:48:49,742 --> 00:48:51,903
My name.

468
00:48:52,978 --> 00:48:54,468
My name.

469
00:49:01,353 --> 00:49:03,821
Smeagol.

470
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:09,585
Black Riders!

471
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,091
Hide! Hide!

472
00:49:21,672 --> 00:49:23,970
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

473
00:49:24,141 --> 00:49:27,770
Quick! They will see us! They will see us!

474
00:49:28,545 --> 00:49:31,207
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?

475
00:49:31,381 --> 00:49:34,350
No, you cannot kill them. No.

476
00:50:01,511 --> 00:50:02,603
Wraiths!

477
00:50:02,813 --> 00:50:05,008
Wraiths on wings!

478
00:50:13,022 --> 00:50:15,047
They are calling for it.

479
00:50:15,291 --> 00:50:18,817
They are calling for the precious.

480
00:50:20,962 --> 00:50:23,089
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

481
00:50:23,264 --> 00:50:24,526
I'm here.

482
00:50:40,548 --> 00:50:42,072
Hurry, Hobbits.

483
00:50:42,651 --> 00:50:46,587
The Black Gate is very close.

484
00:50:53,461 --> 00:50:55,326
Orc blood.

485
00:51:05,273 --> 00:51:07,036
These are strange tracks.

486
00:51:08,309 --> 00:51:10,334
The air is so close in here.

487
00:51:11,479 --> 00:51:13,912
This forest is old.

488
00:51:14,715 --> 00:51:16,706
Very old.

489
00:51:18,485 --> 00:51:20,783
Full of memory...

490
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:25,722
and anger.

491
00:51:31,898 --> 00:51:34,799
The trees are speaking to each other.

492
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:36,457
Gimli!

493
00:51:36,636 --> 00:51:38,570
Lower your ax.

494
00:51:41,374 --> 00:51:44,138
They have feelings, my friend.

495
00:51:44,677 --> 00:51:46,668
The Elves began it.

496
00:51:46,879 --> 00:51:51,612
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.

497
00:51:52,118 --> 00:51:54,484
Talking trees.

498
00:51:55,121 --> 00:51:58,147
What do trees have to talk about?

499
00:51:58,324 --> 00:52:01,487
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.

500
00:52:04,507 --> 00:52:06,457
[Sindarin] <i>Aragorn, nad no ennas!</i>
[English] A thing to be there!

501
00:52:13,242 --> 00:52:15,066
[Sindarin] <i>Man cenich?</i>
[English] What do you see?

502
00:52:15,441 --> 00:52:17,874
The White Wizard approaches.

503
00:52:24,082 --> 00:52:28,382
Do not let him speak. He will put a spell on us.

504
00:52:37,963 --> 00:52:40,226
We must be quick.

505
00:52:55,813 --> 00:52:59,442
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.

506
00:53:00,017 --> 00:53:01,416
Where are they?

507
00:53:01,585 --> 00:53:05,146
They passed this way the day before yesterday.

508
00:53:05,322 --> 00:53:09,588
They met someone they did not expect.

509
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,887
Does that comfort you?

510
00:53:12,062 --> 00:53:14,030
Who are you?

511
00:53:15,499 --> 00:53:17,467
Show yourself!

512
00:53:26,376 --> 00:53:28,367
It cannot be.

513
00:53:31,347 --> 00:53:32,314
Forgive me.

514
00:53:33,983 --> 00:53:35,917
I mistook you for Saruman.

515
00:53:36,686 --> 00:53:39,450
I am Saruman.

516
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:44,858
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.

517
00:53:45,829 --> 00:53:47,319
You fell.

518
00:53:48,798 --> 00:53:51,322
Through fire...

519
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,797
and water.

520
00:53:54,269 --> 00:53:56,794
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak...

521
00:53:56,972 --> 00:54:00,669
I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.

522
00:54:16,525 --> 00:54:19,255
Until at last I threw down my enemy...

523
00:54:19,428 --> 00:54:23,887
and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.

524
00:54:29,904 --> 00:54:32,464
Darkness took me...

525
00:54:33,241 --> 00:54:37,302
and I strayed out of thought and time.

526
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:41,139
Stars wheeled overhead...

527
00:54:41,415 --> 00:54:45,909
and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.

528
00:54:48,055 --> 00:54:50,182
But it was not the end.

529
00:54:50,424 --> 00:54:53,257
I felt life in me again.

530
00:54:55,196 --> 00:54:57,721
I've been sent back...

531
00:54:57,899 --> 00:54:59,457
until my task is done.

532
00:54:59,834 --> 00:55:01,734
Gandalf.

533
00:55:02,403 --> 00:55:04,393
Gandalf?

534
00:55:04,804 --> 00:55:06,601
Yes.

535
00:55:09,409 --> 00:55:11,206
That was what they used to call me.

536
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,344
Gandalf the Grey.

537
00:55:17,684 --> 00:55:19,447
That was my name.

538
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:21,052
Gandalf.

539
00:55:23,023 --> 00:55:25,082
I am Gandalf the White.

540
00:55:28,127 --> 00:55:31,187
And I come back to you now...

541
00:55:31,363 --> 00:55:33,854
at the turn of the tide.

542
00:55:34,967 --> 00:55:37,936
One stage of your journey is over. Another begins.

543
00:55:38,704 --> 00:55:41,867
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?

544
00:55:42,808 --> 00:55:44,833
That is no short distance!

545
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:48,341
We hear of trouble in Rohan. It goes ill with the king.

546
00:55:48,514 --> 00:55:50,607
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.

547
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:54,219
Then we have run all this way for nothing?

548
00:55:54,386 --> 00:55:56,377
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here...

549
00:55:56,555 --> 00:56:00,719
in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested...?

550
00:56:03,329 --> 00:56:06,492
I mean, charming...

551
00:56:06,665 --> 00:56:09,395
quite charming forest.

552
00:56:09,935 --> 00:56:13,598
It was more than mere chance that
brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.

553
00:56:13,806 --> 00:56:18,174
A great power has been sleeping
here for many long years.

554
00:56:18,343 --> 00:56:21,779
The coming of Merry and Pippin will
be like the falling of small stones...

555
00:56:21,946 --> 00:56:25,279
that starts an avalanche in the mountains.

556
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:28,442
I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend.

557
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:32,213
You still speak in riddles.

558
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:41,463
A thing is about to happen that has
not happened since the Elder Days.

559
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:45,260
The Ents are going to wake up...

560
00:56:45,802 --> 00:56:50,296
- and find that they are strong.
- Strong?!

561
00:56:51,108 --> 00:56:52,234
Oh, that's good.

562
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:55,138
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.

563
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,476
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.

564
00:56:58,648 --> 00:57:02,243
In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.

565
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:06,150
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.

566
00:57:28,444 --> 00:57:29,877
That is one of the Mearas...

567
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:32,843
unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.

568
00:57:50,465 --> 00:57:52,729
Shadowfax.

569
00:57:55,303 --> 00:57:57,931
He is the lord of all horses...

570
00:57:59,574 --> 00:58:03,442
and has been my friend through many dangers.

571
00:58:17,692 --> 00:58:21,287
O rowan mine

572
00:58:21,463 --> 00:58:25,263
I saw you shine

573
00:58:25,433 --> 00:58:28,960
Upon a summer's day

574
00:58:30,071 --> 00:58:34,531
Upon your head How golden-red

575
00:58:34,742 --> 00:58:39,473
The crown you bore aloft

576
00:58:39,645 --> 00:58:42,045
Such a beautiful verse.

577
00:58:42,215 --> 00:58:47,118
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.

578
00:58:47,286 --> 00:58:50,551
You might call it far, perhaps.

579
00:58:51,457 --> 00:58:55,257
My home lies deep in the forest...

580
00:58:55,461 --> 00:58:59,363
near the roots of the mountain.

581
00:59:00,633 --> 00:59:04,296
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.

582
00:59:04,537 --> 00:59:08,496
And safe is where I'll keep you.

583
00:59:08,774 --> 00:59:13,143
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.

584
00:59:13,546 --> 00:59:16,538
It's one of my own compositions.

585
00:59:16,716 --> 00:59:17,910
Right.

586
00:59:18,084 --> 00:59:24,216
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves

587
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:29,259
And the dreams of trees unfold

588
00:59:29,428 --> 00:59:35,890
When woodland halls are green and cool

589
00:59:36,102 --> 00:59:40,162
And the wind is in the West

590
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:43,301
Come back to me

591
00:59:43,842 --> 00:59:48,302
Come back to me

592
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:54,907
And say my land is best

593
01:00:02,359 --> 01:00:06,022
Sleep, little Shirelings.

594
01:00:06,197 --> 01:00:09,792
Heed no nightly noise.

595
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,902
Sleep till morning light.

596
01:00:15,539 --> 01:00:19,703
I have business in the forest.

597
01:00:19,877 --> 01:00:25,406
There are many to call. Many that must come.

598
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:31,314
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.

599
01:00:31,488 --> 01:00:37,324
The withering of all woods is drawing near.

600
01:00:46,769 --> 01:00:51,035
The veiling shadow that
glowers in the east takes shape.

601
01:00:51,841 --> 01:00:54,435
Sauron will suffer no rival.

602
01:00:54,877 --> 01:00:59,143
From the summit of Barad-dur,
his Eye watches ceaselessly.

603
01:00:59,315 --> 01:01:02,681
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.

604
01:01:03,719 --> 01:01:05,687
Doubt ever gnaws at him.

605
01:01:05,854 --> 01:01:08,414
The rumor has reached him.

606
01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:11,559
The heir of Numenor still lives.

607
01:01:12,527 --> 01:01:15,360
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.

608
01:01:16,698 --> 01:01:18,859
He fears what you may become.

609
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:23,571
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.

610
01:01:23,739 --> 01:01:27,368
He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan.

611
01:01:27,542 --> 01:01:29,032
War is coming.

612
01:01:29,211 --> 01:01:32,772
Rohan must defend itself, and
therein lies our first challenge...

613
01:01:32,948 --> 01:01:35,382
for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.

614
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:39,247
The king's mind is enslaved,
it's an old device of Saruman's.

615
01:01:39,421 --> 01:01:42,515
His hold over King Theoden is now very strong.

616
01:01:42,691 --> 01:01:47,389
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.

617
01:01:48,229 --> 01:01:50,356
But for all their cunning...

618
01:01:50,564 --> 01:01:53,089
we have one advantage.

619
01:01:55,269 --> 01:01:57,829
The Ring remains hidden.

620
01:01:58,873 --> 01:02:00,773
And that we should seek to destroy it...

621
01:02:00,941 --> 01:02:03,910
has not yet entered their darkest dreams.

622
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:07,811
And so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards Mordor...

623
01:02:07,982 --> 01:02:09,472
in the hands of a Hobbit.

624
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:13,745
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.

625
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,548
We must trust now in Frodo.

626
01:02:16,723 --> 01:02:18,554
Everything depends upon speed...

627
01:02:18,725 --> 01:02:21,717
and the secrecy of his quest.

628
01:02:23,697 --> 01:02:27,030
Do not regret your decision to leave him.

629
01:02:27,901 --> 01:02:30,665
Frodo must finish this task alone.

630
01:02:31,404 --> 01:02:33,736
He's not alone.

631
01:02:33,907 --> 01:02:35,602
Sam went with him.

632
01:02:36,276 --> 01:02:37,470
Did he?

633
01:02:37,644 --> 01:02:42,274
Did he, indeed? Good.

634
01:02:42,882 --> 01:02:45,316
Yes, very good.

635
01:02:53,325 --> 01:02:58,228
The Black Gate of Mordor.

636
01:03:00,966 --> 01:03:03,434
Oh, save us.

637
01:03:09,241 --> 01:03:12,472
My old Gaffer would have a thing or
two to say if he could see us now.

638
01:03:14,713 --> 01:03:19,173
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.

639
01:03:19,351 --> 01:03:22,787
So good Smeagol does, master says so.

640
01:03:22,955 --> 01:03:24,183
I did.

641
01:03:32,964 --> 01:03:34,955
That's it, then.

642
01:03:36,534 --> 01:03:37,831
We can't get past that.

643
01:04:23,013 --> 01:04:24,344
Look!

644
01:04:24,514 --> 01:04:25,981
The gate.

645
01:04:26,149 --> 01:04:27,343
It's opening!

646
01:04:34,791 --> 01:04:36,758
I can see a way down.

647
01:04:37,493 --> 01:04:39,586
Sam, no!

648
01:04:41,797 --> 01:04:43,162
Master!

649
01:06:06,946 --> 01:06:10,473
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.

650
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:14,413
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.

651
01:06:14,854 --> 01:06:16,719
- Now!
- No!

652
01:06:17,290 --> 01:06:19,258
No! No, master!

653
01:06:19,458 --> 01:06:22,427
They catch you! They catch you!

654
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:26,289
Don't take it to him.

655
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:31,965
He wants the precious.

656
01:06:32,138 --> 01:06:35,164
Always he is looking for it.

657
01:06:35,341 --> 01:06:39,243
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.

658
01:06:39,478 --> 01:06:43,380
But we mustn't let him have it.

659
01:06:49,789 --> 01:06:51,882
No! There's another way.

660
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:54,753
More secret. A dark way.

661
01:06:55,061 --> 01:06:58,724
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.

662
01:06:59,198 --> 01:07:00,220
He's up to something.

663
01:07:00,831 --> 01:07:03,425
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?

664
01:07:03,601 --> 01:07:06,331
Yes. There's a path...

665
01:07:06,503 --> 01:07:08,994
and some stairs.

666
01:07:09,206 --> 01:07:10,867
And then...

667
01:07:11,041 --> 01:07:14,374
a tunnel.

668
01:07:28,392 --> 01:07:30,189
He's led us this far, Sam.

669
01:07:30,361 --> 01:07:31,760
Mr. Frodo, no.

670
01:07:32,896 --> 01:07:34,363
He's been true to his word.

671
01:07:39,236 --> 01:07:40,430
No.

672
01:07:42,573 --> 01:07:44,200
Lead the way, Smeagol.

673
01:07:44,808 --> 01:07:48,744
Good Smeagol always helps.

674
01:08:22,711 --> 01:08:23,700
Hello?

675
01:08:26,114 --> 01:08:28,173
Treebeard?

676
01:08:28,884 --> 01:08:30,215
Where has he gone?

677
01:08:30,419 --> 01:08:32,853
I had the loveliest dream last night.

678
01:08:33,488 --> 01:08:36,184
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.

679
01:08:36,358 --> 01:08:38,849
And we smoked all of it. And then...

680
01:08:39,361 --> 01:08:41,295
you were sick.

681
01:08:42,898 --> 01:08:45,731
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.

682
01:08:49,237 --> 01:08:51,171
Did you hear that?

683
01:08:58,246 --> 01:08:59,645
There it is again.

684
01:09:00,582 --> 01:09:05,178
Something's not right here. Not right at all.

685
01:09:08,989 --> 01:09:11,924
You just said something... Treeish.

686
01:09:12,093 --> 01:09:16,086
No, I didn't. I was just stretching.

687
01:09:23,637 --> 01:09:25,501
You're taller.

688
01:09:26,039 --> 01:09:27,529
- Who?
- You!

689
01:09:27,707 --> 01:09:29,334
- Than what?
- Than me!

690
01:09:29,843 --> 01:09:31,970
I've always been taller than you.

691
01:09:32,145 --> 01:09:36,775
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the
tall one. You're the short one.

692
01:09:37,650 --> 01:09:39,140
Please, Merry.

693
01:09:39,352 --> 01:09:43,186
You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?

694
01:09:43,757 --> 01:09:46,590
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".

695
01:09:48,728 --> 01:09:50,992
3'8"!

696
01:09:52,932 --> 01:09:54,763
Three-foot-eight.

697
01:09:57,837 --> 01:09:59,737
You did something.

698
01:10:05,545 --> 01:10:07,137
Merry, don't! Don't drink it!

699
01:10:08,081 --> 01:10:09,547
Merry!

700
01:10:09,748 --> 01:10:12,080
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.

701
01:10:12,251 --> 01:10:16,153
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!

702
01:10:16,321 --> 01:10:18,482
Give me it back. Merry!

703
01:10:20,325 --> 01:10:21,690
What's happening?!

704
01:10:22,561 --> 01:10:24,028
It's got my leg!

705
01:10:24,363 --> 01:10:25,853
Merry!

706
01:10:45,249 --> 01:10:46,841
Help!

707
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:55,489
Away with you.

708
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:57,457
You should not be waking.

709
01:10:57,962 --> 01:11:02,831
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.

710
01:11:03,434 --> 01:11:05,994
Go to sleep.

711
01:11:06,337 --> 01:11:08,202
Away with you.

712
01:11:08,372 --> 01:11:11,671
Come, the forest is waking up.

713
01:11:12,243 --> 01:11:14,176
It isn't safe.

714
01:11:16,847 --> 01:11:20,783
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.

715
01:11:20,951 --> 01:11:23,943
Anger festers in their hearts.

716
01:11:24,821 --> 01:11:26,448
Black are their thoughts.

717
01:11:26,623 --> 01:11:29,148
Strong is their hate.

718
01:11:29,326 --> 01:11:32,090
They will harm you if they can.

719
01:11:32,262 --> 01:11:35,823
There are too few of us now.

720
01:11:35,999 --> 01:11:39,992
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

721
01:11:40,637 --> 01:11:43,265
Why are there so few of you
when you have lived so long?

722
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:46,637
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.

723
01:11:46,810 --> 01:11:52,441
There have been no Entings for
a terrible long count of years.

724
01:11:52,648 --> 01:11:57,881
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.

725
01:11:58,153 --> 01:11:59,552
Oh, I'm sorry.

726
01:11:59,655 --> 01:12:03,591
- How did they die?
- Die? No.

727
01:12:03,759 --> 01:12:06,990
We lost them.

728
01:12:07,162 --> 01:12:12,225
And now we cannot find them.

729
01:12:12,401 --> 01:12:18,635
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?

730
01:12:19,028 --> 01:12:21,588
Can't say that I have.

731
01:12:22,132 --> 01:12:24,157
You, Pip?

732
01:12:25,635 --> 01:12:28,035
What do they look like?

733
01:12:30,473 --> 01:12:35,137
I don't remember now.

734
01:12:51,561 --> 01:12:55,463
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.

735
01:12:56,232 --> 01:12:58,860
There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan...

736
01:12:59,568 --> 01:13:02,435
whose mind is overthrown.

737
01:13:02,604 --> 01:13:06,870
Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong.

738
01:13:07,509 --> 01:13:10,672
My lord, your son...

739
01:13:10,846 --> 01:13:13,041
he is dead.

740
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:16,347
My lord?

741
01:13:17,619 --> 01:13:18,779
Uncle?

742
01:13:25,593 --> 01:13:27,857
Will you not go to him?

743
01:13:30,998 --> 01:13:33,398
Will you do nothing?

744
01:13:33,568 --> 01:13:35,536
Be careful what you say.

745
01:13:35,770 --> 01:13:37,897
Do not look for welcome here.

746
01:14:01,963 --> 01:14:06,093
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.

747
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:08,427
What a tragedy for the king...

748
01:14:08,669 --> 01:14:11,637
to lose his only son and heir.

749
01:14:12,739 --> 01:14:17,267
I understand. His passing is hard to accept.

750
01:14:17,444 --> 01:14:22,346
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.

751
01:14:22,514 --> 01:14:23,981
Leave me alone, snake!

752
01:14:25,451 --> 01:14:27,078
Oh, but you are alone.

753
01:14:28,721 --> 01:14:33,488
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness...

754
01:14:33,659 --> 01:14:37,117
in the bitter watches of the night...

755
01:14:37,296 --> 01:14:40,959
when all your life seems to shrink.

756
01:14:41,166 --> 01:14:45,364
The walls of your bower closing in about you.

757
01:14:45,537 --> 01:14:50,099
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

758
01:14:52,344 --> 01:14:54,244
So fair.

759
01:14:55,514 --> 01:14:56,879
So cold.

760
01:14:58,651 --> 01:15:00,812
Like a morning of pale spring...

761
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:04,456
still clinging to winter's chill.

762
01:15:18,237 --> 01:15:20,728
Your words are poison.

763
01:16:53,294 --> 01:16:55,762
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

764
01:17:10,111 --> 01:17:13,911
I cannot allow you before Theoden
King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.

765
01:17:15,417 --> 01:17:17,977
By order of Grima Wormtongue.

766
01:17:35,335 --> 01:17:37,098
Your staff.

767
01:17:40,507 --> 01:17:43,999
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.

768
01:18:02,795 --> 01:18:05,662
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

769
01:18:13,973 --> 01:18:15,531
He's a herald of woe.

770
01:18:15,708 --> 01:18:20,145
The courtesy of your hall is
somewhat lessened of late...

771
01:18:21,247 --> 01:18:22,680
Theoden King.

772
01:18:23,382 --> 01:18:25,907
He's not welcome.

773
01:18:26,853 --> 01:18:32,189
Why should I welcome you...

774
01:18:32,692 --> 01:18:36,354
Gandalf Stormcrow?

775
01:18:36,528 --> 01:18:39,827
A just question, my liege.

776
01:18:39,998 --> 01:18:42,865
Late is the hour...

777
01:18:43,034 --> 01:18:46,993
in which this conjurer chooses to appear.

778
01:18:47,806 --> 01:18:49,865
Lathspell I name him.

779
01:18:50,041 --> 01:18:52,942
Ill news is an ill guest.

780
01:18:53,111 --> 01:18:57,672
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.

781
01:18:57,848 --> 01:18:59,782
I have not passed through fire and death...

782
01:18:59,884 --> 01:19:03,115
to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.

783
01:19:04,121 --> 01:19:06,214
His staff.

784
01:19:06,423 --> 01:19:10,553
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

785
01:19:13,898 --> 01:19:15,832
Theoden...

786
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,960
son of Thengel...

787
01:19:20,738 --> 01:19:23,104
too long have you sat in the Shadows.

788
01:19:26,076 --> 01:19:29,341
I would stay still if I were you.

789
01:19:29,513 --> 01:19:31,606
Hearken to me!

790
01:19:37,121 --> 01:19:39,247
I release you...

791
01:19:39,455 --> 01:19:41,423
from the spell.

792
01:19:52,969 --> 01:19:55,995
You have no power here...

793
01:19:56,172 --> 01:19:59,801
Gandalf the Grey.

794
01:20:05,214 --> 01:20:10,276
I will draw you, Saruman, as
poison is drawn from a wound.

795
01:20:19,728 --> 01:20:21,252
Wait.

796
01:20:22,698 --> 01:20:26,532
If I go, Theoden dies.

797
01:20:27,235 --> 01:20:29,430
You did not kill me...

798
01:20:29,605 --> 01:20:31,800
you will not kill him.

799
01:20:35,711 --> 01:20:37,406
Rohan is mine.

800
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,211
Be gone.

801
01:21:24,724 --> 01:21:26,851
I know your face.

802
01:21:31,431 --> 01:21:32,693
Eowyn.

803
01:21:35,001 --> 01:21:36,263
Eowyn.

804
01:21:44,543 --> 01:21:45,737
Gandalf?

805
01:21:46,278 --> 01:21:49,145
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

806
01:22:02,494 --> 01:22:05,088
Dark have been my dreams of late.

807
01:22:09,234 --> 01:22:13,000
Your fingers would remember
their old strength better...

808
01:22:13,172 --> 01:22:16,141
if they grasped your sword.

809
01:23:01,251 --> 01:23:03,219
I've only...

810
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:06,480
ever served you, my lord.

811
01:23:06,656 --> 01:23:11,650
Your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast!

812
01:23:12,662 --> 01:23:14,596
Send me not from your sight.

813
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:19,630
No, my lord! No, my lord.

814
01:23:19,836 --> 01:23:21,030
Let him go.

815
01:23:21,738 --> 01:23:24,969
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.

816
01:23:34,117 --> 01:23:36,449
Get out of my way!

817
01:23:38,688 --> 01:23:41,851
Hail, Theoden King!

818
01:24:06,447 --> 01:24:08,938
Where is Theodred?

819
01:24:11,986 --> 01:24:14,546
Where is my son?

820

Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forbearers.

827
01:25:56,088 --> 01:25:59,056
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.

828
01:26:01,126 --> 01:26:04,994
Alas that these evil days should be mine.

829
01:26:05,764 --> 01:26:10,166
The young perish and the old linger.

830
01:26:10,768 --> 01:26:12,861
That I should live...

831
01:26:13,037 --> 01:26:16,404
to see the last days of my house.

832
01:26:17,675 --> 01:26:21,543
Theodred's death was not of your making.

833
01:26:24,581 --> 01:26:27,982
No parent should have to bury their child.

834
01:26:44,702 --> 01:26:46,567
He was strong in life.

835
01:26:47,671 --> 01:26:51,232
His spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers.

[English] Go-thou, Théodred, go-thou.

838
01:27:35,851 --> 01:27:37,751
They had no warning.

839
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:40,319
They were unarmed.

840
01:27:40,789 --> 01:27:44,816
Now the Wild Men are moving through
the Westfold, burning as they go.

841
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:47,729
Rick, cot and tree.

842
01:27:48,030 --> 01:27:50,260
Where is Mama?

843
01:27:51,033 --> 01:27:55,265
This is but a taste of the
terror that Saruman will unleash.

844
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:59,804
All the more potent for he is
driven now by fear of Sauron.

845
01:28:01,410 --> 01:28:04,378
Ride out and meet him head on.

846
01:28:05,146 --> 01:28:08,638
Draw him away from your women and children.

847
01:28:08,983 --> 01:28:10,610
You must fight.

848
01:28:10,785 --> 01:28:14,619
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.

849
01:28:14,789 --> 01:28:16,416
Eomer is loyal to you.

850
01:28:16,590 --> 01:28:19,286
His men will return and fight for their king.

851
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:23,362
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.

852
01:28:27,034 --> 01:28:29,264
Eomer cannot help us.

853
01:28:29,904 --> 01:28:31,666
I know what it is you want of me...

854
01:28:31,871 --> 01:28:35,136
but I will not bring further death to my people.

855
01:28:36,810 --> 01:28:38,505
I will not risk open war.

856
01:28:40,713 --> 01:28:44,080
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.

857
01:28:48,354 --> 01:28:49,981
When last I looked...

858
01:28:50,423 --> 01:28:54,052
Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.

859
01:29:00,867 --> 01:29:03,131
Then what is the king's decision?

860
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:10,071
By order of the king...

861
01:29:10,242 --> 01:29:11,709
the city must empty.

862
01:29:12,878 --> 01:29:15,745
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.

863
01:29:16,048 --> 01:29:19,950
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

864
01:29:20,152 --> 01:29:21,642
Helm's Deep.

865
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:25,347
They flee to the mountains when
they should stand and fight.

866
01:29:25,524 --> 01:29:27,492
Who will defend them if not their king?

867
01:29:27,659 --> 01:29:30,127
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.

868
01:29:30,295 --> 01:29:32,092
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.

869
01:29:32,264 --> 01:29:36,166
There is no way out of that ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap.

870
01:29:36,368 --> 01:29:38,529
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

871
01:29:38,737 --> 01:29:40,864
What they will get is a massacre.

872
01:29:42,441 --> 01:29:44,908
Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.

873
01:29:45,810 --> 01:29:49,143
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

874
01:29:49,614 --> 01:29:52,481
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.

875
01:29:52,950 --> 01:29:55,748
The people of Rohan will need you.

876
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:58,588
The defenses have to hold.

877
01:30:00,024 --> 01:30:01,753
They will hold.

878
01:30:05,763 --> 01:30:08,061
The Grey Pilgrim.

879
01:30:08,232 --> 01:30:10,859
That's what they used to call me.

880
01:30:11,067 --> 01:30:16,130
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked
this earth, and now I have no time.

881
01:30:17,774 --> 01:30:19,969
With luck, my search will not be in vain.

882
01:30:20,510 --> 01:30:23,809
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.

883
01:30:24,681 --> 01:30:27,377
At dawn, look to the east.

884
01:30:27,551 --> 01:30:29,109
Go.

885
01:30:56,445 --> 01:30:59,778
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do. Leave him.

01:31:42,390 --> 01:31:44,290
He was my cousin's horse.

896
01:31:44,525 --> 01:31:46,322
Brego.

01:31:58,574 --> 01:32:00,174
[Sindarin] <i>Man cenich?</i>
[English] What did you see?

900
01:32:01,042 --> 01:32:03,442
I have heard of the magic of Elves...

901
01:32:03,611 --> 01:32:06,909
but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.

902
01:32:07,948 --> 01:32:10,382
You speak as one of their own.

903
01:32:12,185 --> 01:32:14,619
I was raised in Rivendell...

904
01:32:14,888 --> 01:32:16,411
for a time.

905
01:32:19,725 --> 01:32:21,750
Turn this fellow free.

906
01:32:22,428 --> 01:32:24,896
He's seen enough of war.

907
01:32:36,676 --> 01:32:39,543
Gandalf the White.

908
01:32:39,712 --> 01:32:42,078
Gandalf the Fool!

909
01:32:43,349 --> 01:32:47,410
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?

910
01:32:48,654 --> 01:32:52,590
There were three who followed the wizard.

911
01:32:52,992 --> 01:32:58,362
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.

912
01:32:58,731 --> 01:33:01,461
You stink of horse.

913
01:33:06,739 --> 01:33:08,604
The Man...

914
01:33:10,643 --> 01:33:14,841
- was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.

915
01:33:15,014 --> 01:33:18,812
One of the Dunedain Rangers, I thought he was.

916
01:33:18,982 --> 01:33:20,779
His cloth was poor.

917
01:33:21,685 --> 01:33:26,816
And yet he bore a strange ring.

918
01:33:27,925 --> 01:33:31,452
Two serpents with emerald eyes.

919
01:33:31,662 --> 01:33:37,498
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.

920
01:33:37,668 --> 01:33:39,568
The Ring of Barahir.

921
01:33:40,537 --> 01:33:44,132
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.

922
01:33:44,308 --> 01:33:47,641
The lost king of Gondor. He is a fool.

923
01:33:47,811 --> 01:33:50,541
The line was broken years ago.

924
01:33:51,915 --> 01:33:53,439
It matters not.

925
01:33:53,617 --> 01:33:56,142
The world of Men shall fall.

926
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:58,185
It will begin at Edoras.

927
01:34:07,364 --> 01:34:09,298
I am ready, Gamling.

928
01:34:09,466 --> 01:34:11,934
Bring my horse.

929
01:34:15,105 --> 01:34:16,470
This is not a defeat.

930
01:34:18,876 --> 01:34:20,104
We will return.

931
01:34:25,548 --> 01:34:27,948
We will return.

932
01:34:51,373 --> 01:34:53,307
You have some skill with a blade.

933
01:35:01,750 --> 01:35:03,843
Women of this country learned long ago:

934
01:35:04,019 --> 01:35:06,647
Those without swords can still die upon them.

935
01:35:06,822 --> 01:35:08,653
I fear neither death nor pain.

936
01:35:09,925 --> 01:35:12,018
What do you fear, my lady?

937
01:35:15,430 --> 01:35:17,261
A cage.

938
01:35:18,567 --> 01:35:22,401
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.

939
01:35:22,571 --> 01:35:26,472
And all chance of valor has
gone beyond recall or desire.

940
01:35:29,910 --> 01:35:31,935
You're a daughter of kings...

941
01:35:33,214 --> 01:35:36,513
a shield maiden of Rohan.

942
01:35:41,822 --> 01:35:44,312
I do not think that would be your fate.

943
01:36:17,390 --> 01:36:20,382
Theoden will not stay at Edoras.

944
01:36:20,593 --> 01:36:22,652
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

945
01:36:22,862 --> 01:36:25,763
He will expect an attack on the city.

946
01:36:27,066 --> 01:36:30,330
They will flee to Helm's Deep...

947
01:36:30,502 --> 01:36:32,834
the great fortress of Rohan.

948
01:36:34,039 --> 01:36:38,442
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.

949
01:36:39,878 --> 01:36:41,607
They will be slow.

950
01:36:41,980 --> 01:36:46,417
They will have women and children with them.

951
01:36:50,322 --> 01:36:52,552
Send out your Warg-riders.

952
01:37:07,405 --> 01:37:10,306
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.

953
01:37:10,474 --> 01:37:13,136
- Why do you do that?
- What?

954
01:37:13,311 --> 01:37:15,836
Call him names. Run him down all the time.

955
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:18,305
Because.

956
01:37:19,850 --> 01:37:21,977
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

957
01:37:22,186 --> 01:37:24,347
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.

958
01:37:24,822 --> 01:37:27,586
It's the Ring he wants. It's all he cares about.

959
01:37:27,758 --> 01:37:30,022
You have no idea what it did to him...

960
01:37:30,194 --> 01:37:32,661
what it's still doing to him.

961
01:37:34,898 --> 01:37:36,991
I want to help him, Sam.

962
01:37:37,167 --> 01:37:38,429
Why?

963
01:37:43,740 --> 01:37:46,868
Because I have to believe he can come back.

964
01:37:51,114 --> 01:37:53,048
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

965
01:37:53,216 --> 01:37:55,946
What do you know about it? Nothing!

966
01:38:02,859 --> 01:38:07,056
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know why I said that.

967
01:38:07,896 --> 01:38:09,022
I do.

968
01:38:11,066 --> 01:38:12,931
It's the Ring.

969
01:38:13,502 --> 01:38:15,060
You can't take your eyes off it.

970
01:38:15,804 --> 01:38:17,772
I've seen you.

971
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:22,074
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

972
01:38:23,846 --> 01:38:26,076
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

973
01:38:26,248 --> 01:38:28,944
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.

974
01:38:29,151 --> 01:38:32,086
The Ring was entrusted to me. It's my task.

975
01:38:32,254 --> 01:38:33,949
Mine! My own!

976
01:38:34,822 --> 01:38:36,915
Can't you hear yourself?

977
01:38:37,125 --> 01:38:38,786
Don't you know who you sound like?

978
01:38:49,070 --> 01:38:51,197
We wants it.

979
01:38:51,372 --> 01:38:54,068
We needs it.

980
01:38:54,242 --> 01:38:59,043
Must have the precious.

981
01:38:59,213 --> 01:39:02,580
They stole it from us.

982
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:06,151
Sneaky little Hobbitses.

983
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:10,222
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

984
01:39:10,391 --> 01:39:13,656
No. Not master.

985
01:39:13,828 --> 01:39:17,661
Yes, precious. False.

986
01:39:17,831 --> 01:39:22,325
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

987
01:39:23,470 --> 01:39:25,938
Master's my friend.

988
01:39:26,106 --> 01:39:31,169
You don't have any friends. Nobody likes you.

989
01:39:32,446 --> 01:39:34,937
Not listening. I'm not listening.

990
01:39:35,115 --> 01:39:39,107
You're a liar and a thief.

991
01:39:39,785 --> 01:39:41,309
No.

992
01:39:42,254 --> 01:39:45,155
Murderer.

993
01:39:47,626 --> 01:39:48,650
Go away.

994
01:39:48,828 --> 01:39:51,194
Go away?

995
01:39:53,199 --> 01:39:55,997
I hate you.

996
01:39:56,168 --> 01:39:58,568
I hate you.

997
01:39:58,871 --> 01:40:02,170
Where would you be without me? Gollum. Gollum.

998
01:40:02,341 --> 01:40:04,172
I saved us.

999
01:40:04,343 --> 01:40:08,871
It was me. We survived because of me.

1000
01:40:10,116 --> 01:40:13,677
Not anymore.

1001
01:40:15,054 --> 01:40:16,578
What did you say?

1002
01:40:18,691 --> 01:40:22,525
Master looks after us now.

1003
01:40:22,695 --> 01:40:26,187
We don't need you.

1004
01:40:26,899 --> 01:40:28,457
What?

1005
01:40:28,634 --> 01:40:30,396
Leave now...

1006
01:40:30,568 --> 01:40:34,368
and never come back.

1007
01:40:34,539 --> 01:40:35,563
No.

1008
01:40:36,074 --> 01:40:40,272
Leave now and never come back.

1009
01:40:42,913 --> 01:40:48,818
Leave now and never come back!

1010
01:41:00,731 --> 01:41:03,427
We told him to go away.

1011
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:06,569
And away he goes, precious.

1012
01:41:06,737 --> 01:41:08,728
Gone! Gone! Gone!

1013
01:41:08,906 --> 01:41:10,737
Smeagol is free!

1014
01:41:15,612 --> 01:41:17,102
Look.

1015
01:41:17,314 --> 01:41:21,774
Look. See what Smeagol finds?

1016
01:41:31,328 --> 01:41:32,761
They are young.

1017
01:41:32,930 --> 01:41:35,455
They are tender. They are nice.

1018
01:41:35,632 --> 01:41:39,159
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!

1019
01:41:41,871 --> 01:41:43,463
You'll make him sick, you will...

1020
01:41:44,673 --> 01:41:46,868
behaving like that.

1021
01:41:49,311 --> 01:41:52,041
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.

1022
01:41:56,284 --> 01:41:57,808
What's it doing?

1023
01:41:58,553 --> 01:42:01,147
Stupid, fat Hobbit.

1024
01:42:01,323 --> 01:42:03,518
It ruins it.

1025
01:42:03,692 --> 01:42:07,321
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat on them.

1026
01:42:11,466 --> 01:42:14,026
What we need is a few good taters.

1027
01:42:14,903 --> 01:42:17,963
What's taters, precious?

1028
01:42:18,139 --> 01:42:19,868
What's taters? Eh?

1029
01:42:20,041 --> 01:42:21,770
Po-ta-toes.

1030
01:42:22,110 --> 01:42:25,341
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.

1031
01:42:26,882 --> 01:42:32,343
Lovely, big, golden chips with
a nice piece of fried fish.

1032
01:42:33,688 --> 01:42:35,588
Even you couldn't say no to that.

1033
01:42:35,924 --> 01:42:38,119
Oh, yes, we could.

1034
01:42:38,293 --> 01:42:41,785
Spoil a nice fish.

1035
01:42:43,064 --> 01:42:45,692
Give it to us raw...

1036
01:42:45,867 --> 01:42:48,892
and wriggling.

1037
01:42:49,069 --> 01:42:52,197
You keep nasty chips.

1038
01:42:53,139 --> 01:42:55,198
You're hopeless.

1039
01:43:07,687 --> 01:43:09,177
Mr. Frodo?

1040
01:43:27,073 --> 01:43:29,735
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.

1041
01:43:29,943 --> 01:43:32,411
Servants of Sauron.

1042
01:43:33,212 --> 01:43:35,373
They are called to Mordor.

1043
01:43:35,581 --> 01:43:38,573
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.

1044
01:43:38,785 --> 01:43:41,948
It won't be long now. He will soon be ready.

1045
01:43:43,523 --> 01:43:47,186
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.

1046
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:52,524
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.

1047
01:43:52,798 --> 01:43:55,858
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

1048
01:43:56,034 --> 01:43:57,262
Mr. Frodo.

1049
01:43:57,769 --> 01:43:59,396
Look.

1050
01:44:02,975 --> 01:44:05,272
It's an oliphaunt.

1051
01:44:13,484 --> 01:44:16,510
No one at home will believe this.

1052
01:44:27,665 --> 01:44:29,530
Smeagol?

1053
01:45:09,906 --> 01:45:12,374
We've lingered here too long.

1054
01:45:15,378 --> 01:45:16,708
Come on, Sam.

1055
01:45:30,192 --> 01:45:32,888
Wait! We're innocent travelers!

1056
01:45:34,596 --> 01:45:39,693
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.

1057
01:45:39,868 --> 01:45:42,769
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.

1058
01:45:44,173 --> 01:45:47,540
Those that claim to oppose the
enemy would do well not to hinder us.

1059
01:45:47,709 --> 01:45:49,734
The enemy?

1060
01:45:51,847 --> 01:45:55,339
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.

1061
01:45:57,785 --> 01:45:59,844
You wonder what his name is...

1062
01:46:01,355 --> 01:46:03,619
where he came from.

1063
01:46:05,593 --> 01:46:08,027
And if he was really evil at heart.

1064
01:46:09,697 --> 01:46:13,155
What lies or threats led him
on this long march from home.

1065
01:46:14,769 --> 01:46:17,260
If he would not rather have stayed there...

1066
01:46:19,474 --> 01:46:20,964
in peace.

1067
01:46:24,545 --> 01:46:27,571
War will make corpses of us all.

1068
01:46:27,748 --> 01:46:29,806
Bind their hands.
