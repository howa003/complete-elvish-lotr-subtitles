2
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:08,902
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.

3
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:12,772
And in fact, they are so alike
in voice and appearance...

4
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:16,108
that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.

5
00:00:16,515 --> 00:00:18,415
It's the beards.

6
00:00:18,617 --> 00:00:20,745
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief...

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,788
that there are no Dwarf women...

8
00:00:23,956 --> 00:00:28,223
and that Dwarves just spring
out of holes in the ground...

9
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:31,760
which is, of course, ridiculous.

10
00:00:37,903 --> 00:00:40,133
It's all right. Nobody panic.

11
00:00:40,606 --> 00:00:42,631
That was deliberate. It was deliberate.

12
00:00:44,576 --> 00:00:48,376
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.

13
00:00:48,646 --> 00:00:51,411
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.

14
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:53,882
Cut down by Orcs.

15
00:00:54,052 --> 00:00:57,045
She watched her mother succumb to grief.

16
00:00:57,656 --> 00:01:02,285
Then she was left alone, to
tend her king in growing fear.

17
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,022
Doomed to wait upon an old man who
should have loved her as a father.

18
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:19,407
Gimli.

19
00:01:19,577 --> 00:01:21,636
No, I couldn't

20
00:01:21,813 --> 00:01:23,644
I really couldn't.

21
00:01:28,152 --> 00:01:29,779
I made some stew.

22
00:01:29,953 --> 00:01:33,219
It isn't much, but it's hot.

23
00:01:41,032 --> 00:01:43,090
Thank you.

24
00:02:03,586 --> 00:02:06,112
- It's good.
- Really?

25
00:02:10,093 --> 00:02:13,460
My uncle told me a strange thing.

26
00:02:14,764 --> 00:02:18,825
He said that you rode to war
with Thengel, my grandfather.

27
00:02:19,268 --> 00:02:21,737
But he must be mistaken.

28
00:02:22,004 --> 00:02:26,408
King Theoden has a good memory. He
was only a small child at the time.

29
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:30,741
Then you must be at least 60.

30
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:34,407
Seventy?

31
00:02:34,851 --> 00:02:36,513
But you cannot be 80!

32
00:02:39,856 --> 00:02:41,221
Eighty-seven.

33
00:02:44,327 --> 00:02:46,420
You are one of the Dunedain.

34
00:02:47,496 --> 00:02:50,590
A descendant of Numenor, blessed with long life.

35
00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:54,462
It was said that your race had passed into legend.

36
00:02:55,137 --> 00:02:56,900
There are few of us left.

37
00:02:57,074 --> 00:02:59,836
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.

38
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,011
I'm sorry. Please, eat.

39
00:03:18,661 --> 00:03:22,790
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.

40
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,034
It is mine to give to whom I will.

41
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,270
Like my heart.

42
00:03:32,707 --> 00:03:35,403
Go to sleep.

43
00:03:33,696 --> 00:03:48,419

44
00:03:35,577 --> 00:03:38,068
I am asleep.

45
00:03:44,552 --> 00:03:46,486
This is a dream.

46
00:03:48,722 --> 00:03:51,920
Then it is a good dream.

65

The woman who gave you that jewel.

66
00:06:09,061 --> 00:06:11,824
Our time here is ending.

67
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:15,055
Arwen's time is ending.

68
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,095
Let her go.

69
00:06:17,269 --> 00:06:19,259
Let her take the ship into the west.

70
00:06:19,471 --> 00:06:22,531
Let her bear away her love
for you to the Undying Lands.

71
00:06:22,707 --> 00:06:24,504
There it will be ever green.

72
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,376
But never more than memory.

73
00:06:29,647 --> 00:06:32,673
I will not leave my daughter here to die.

74
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,479
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.

75
00:06:36,654 --> 00:06:38,952
She belongs with her people.

76
00:06:51,022 --> 00:06:53,603
[Sindarin] <i>Nach gwannatha sin?</i>
[English] Are you going to leave in such way?

77
00:06:54,472 --> 00:06:57,990
[Sindarin] <i>Ma nathach hi gwannathach or minuial archened?</i>
[English] You would depart after the stars fade - unseen?

78
00:07:00,396 --> 00:07:01,972
[Sindarin] <i>Ú-ethelithon.</i>
[English] I will not return.

79
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,072
[Sindarin] <i>Estelio guru lîn ne dagor.</i>
[English] Trust in your skill in battle.

80
00:07:05,772 --> 00:07:06,972
[Sindarin] <i>Ethelithach.</i>
[English] You will return.

81
00:07:07,272 --> 00:07:08,772
[Sindarin] <i> Ú-bedin o gurth ne dagor.</i>
[English] I don’t speak about death in battle.

82
00:07:09,072 --> 00:07:11,072

00:07:16,672 --> 00:07:20,611
[Sindarin] <i>Edra le men, men na guil edwen...</i>
[English] A path is opened for you, a path to another life...

84
00:07:22,172 --> 00:07:25,872
[Sindarin] <i>haer o auth a nîr a naeth.</i>
[English] ...far from war and weeping and woe.

85
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,101
Why are you saying this?

86
00:07:30,673 --> 00:07:33,870
I am mortal. You are Elf-kind.

87
00:07:35,311 --> 00:07:37,973
It was a dream, Arwen.

88
00:07:38,414 --> 00:07:39,778
Nothing more.

89
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:44,381
I don't believe you.

90
00:07:53,396 --> 00:07:55,226
This belongs to you.

91
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,558
It was a gift.

92
00:08:02,171 --> 00:08:03,695
Keep it.

93
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,403
My lord?

94
00:08:10,212 --> 00:08:14,774
She is sailing to the Undying Lands
with all that is left of her kin.

95
00:08:38,273 --> 00:08:39,739
What is it?

96
00:08:41,242 --> 00:08:43,301
- Hama?
- I'm not sure.

97
00:08:59,827 --> 00:09:01,851
Wargs!

98
00:09:14,409 --> 00:09:16,104
A scout!

99
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,941
- What is it? What do you see?
- Warg! We're under attack!

100
00:09:26,287 --> 00:09:28,482
Get them out of here!

101
00:09:33,261 --> 00:09:35,252
All riders to the head of the column.

102
00:09:35,997 --> 00:09:37,966
Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.

103
00:09:38,165 --> 00:09:39,894
Come on!

104
00:09:51,712 --> 00:09:54,145
You must lead the people to
Helm's Deep, and make haste.

105
00:09:54,347 --> 00:09:55,815
- I can fight.
- No!

106
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:00,578
You must do this, for me.

107
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,182
Follow me!

108
00:10:07,728 --> 00:10:12,027
- Forward. I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!

109
00:10:12,232 --> 00:10:14,895
- That's it! Go on!
- Stay together!

110
00:11:27,105 --> 00:11:29,404
Bring your pretty face to my ax.

111
00:11:32,211 --> 00:11:33,768
That one counts as mine!

112
00:11:50,495 --> 00:11:52,122
Stinking creature.

113
00:13:19,316 --> 00:13:21,215
Aragorn!

114
00:13:25,955 --> 00:13:27,422
Aragorn?

115
00:13:41,402 --> 00:13:44,337
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.

116
00:13:44,507 --> 00:13:45,939
He's...

117
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:48,101
dead.

118
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:51,644
He took a little tumble off the cliff.

119
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,547
You lie.

120
00:14:30,451 --> 00:14:32,043
Get the wounded on horses.

121
00:14:33,388 --> 00:14:36,515
The wolves of Isengard will return.

122
00:14:36,957 --> 00:14:39,050
Leave the dead.

123
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,990
Come.

124
00:14:58,179 --> 00:14:59,702
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.

125
00:14:59,881 --> 00:15:02,781
There it is, Helm's Deep.

126
00:15:05,351 --> 00:15:07,149
We're safe!

127
00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:11,556
We're safe, my lady.

128
00:15:11,724 --> 00:15:12,919
Thank you.

129
00:15:57,303 --> 00:15:58,702
- Mama!
- Eothain!

130
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,361
Freda!

131
00:16:06,111 --> 00:16:08,945
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.

132
00:16:12,818 --> 00:16:14,114
Take it to the caves.

133
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:17,152
Make way for the king.

134
00:16:18,189 --> 00:16:21,989
Make way for Theoden. Make way for the king.

135
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:33,632
So few. So few of you have returned.

136
00:16:36,407 --> 00:16:38,672
Our people are safe.

137
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:42,571
We have paid for it with many lives.

138
00:16:43,414 --> 00:16:44,939
My lady.

139
00:16:48,686 --> 00:16:50,950
Lord Aragorn...

140
00:16:51,122 --> 00:16:52,350
where is he?

141
00:16:54,358 --> 00:16:55,883
He fell.

142
00:17:18,548 --> 00:17:21,518
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

143
00:17:21,685 --> 00:17:24,620
Bar the gate. And set a watch on the surround.

144
00:17:24,855 --> 00:17:27,948
What of those who cannot fight,
my lord? The women and children?

145
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,719
Get them into the caves.

146
00:17:31,595 --> 00:17:36,463
Saruman's arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.

147
00:17:38,502 --> 00:17:41,903
Helm's Deep has one weakness.

148
00:17:42,071 --> 00:17:44,404
Its outer wall is solid rock...

149
00:17:44,574 --> 00:17:47,669
but for a small culvert at its base...

150
00:17:47,844 --> 00:17:50,608
which is little more than a drain.

151
00:17:53,483 --> 00:17:57,647
How? How can fire undo stone?

152
00:17:57,821 --> 00:18:02,314
What kind of device could bring down the wall?

153
00:18:05,928 --> 00:18:09,922
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.

154
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:13,626
Even if it is breached, it would
take a number beyond reckoning...

155
00:18:13,804 --> 00:18:16,364
thousands, to storm the Keep.

156
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,972
Tens of thousands.

157
00:18:18,141 --> 00:18:22,202
But, my lord, there is no such force.

158
00:18:34,157 --> 00:18:37,251
A new power is rising.

159
00:18:37,426 --> 00:18:40,418
Its victory is at hand.

160
00:18:46,103 --> 00:18:48,160
This night...

161
00:18:48,604 --> 00:18:52,937
the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!

162
00:18:53,109 --> 00:18:56,442
March to Helm's Deep!

163
00:18:56,612 --> 00:19:00,048
Leave none alive!

164
00:19:02,585 --> 00:19:05,052
To war!

165
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:13,451
There will be no dawn for Men.

166
00:19:30,646 --> 00:19:32,703
Look. There's smoke to the south.

167
00:19:32,914 --> 00:19:36,042
There is always smoke rising...

168
00:19:36,284 --> 00:19:40,118
from Isengard these days.

169
00:19:40,355 --> 00:19:41,947
Isengard?

170
00:19:42,157 --> 00:19:44,022
There was a time...

171
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:47,885
when Saruman would walk in my woods.

172
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:51,430
But now he has a mind of metal...

173
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,533
and wheels.

174
00:19:55,303 --> 00:19:59,797
He no longer cares for growing things.

175
00:19:59,974 --> 00:20:01,771
What is it?

176
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,975
It's Saruman's army.

177
00:20:09,183 --> 00:20:10,707
The war has started.

178
00:20:49,088 --> 00:20:53,457
May the grace of the Valar protect you.

179
00:21:25,725 --> 00:21:27,589
Brego.

180
00:21:53,718 --> 00:21:54,913
Arwen.

181
00:21:55,974 --> 00:21:57,974
[Sindarin] <i>Tollen, i lû.</i>
[English] Come, it is time.

182
00:21:59,974 --> 00:22:03,774
[Sindarin] <i>I chair gwannar na Valannor. Si bado, no círar.</i>
[English] The ships depart to Valinor. Now go, before they sail.

183
00:22:04,696 --> 00:22:06,492
I have made my choice.

184
00:22:12,937 --> 00:22:15,804
He is not coming back.

185
00:22:17,241 --> 00:22:20,574
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?

186
00:22:21,512 --> 00:22:24,482
There is still hope.

187
00:22:28,652 --> 00:22:32,418
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.

188
00:22:35,826 --> 00:22:38,795
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king...

189
00:22:38,963 --> 00:22:41,454
and all that you hope for comes true...

190
00:22:41,632 --> 00:22:46,330
you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality.

191
00:22:46,603 --> 00:22:49,596
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time...

192
00:22:49,773 --> 00:22:52,743
Aragorn will die.

193
00:22:55,579 --> 00:22:58,104
And there will be no comfort for you...

194
00:22:58,315 --> 00:23:02,478
no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.

195
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:08,019
He will come to death...

196
00:23:08,191 --> 00:23:10,785
an image of the splendor of the kings of Men...

197
00:23:10,961 --> 00:23:15,624
in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.

198
00:23:24,741 --> 00:23:28,677
But you, my daughter...

199
00:23:29,511 --> 00:23:34,539
you will linger on in darkness and in doubt...

200
00:23:34,717 --> 00:23:38,778
as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.

201
00:23:41,191 --> 00:23:43,590
Here you will dwell...

202
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,662
bound to your grief under the fading trees...

203
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,390
until all the world is changed...

204
00:23:52,568 --> 00:23:57,063
and the long years of your life are utterly spent.

205
00:24:05,581 --> 00:24:06,741
Arwen.

206
00:24:13,388 --> 00:24:15,651
There is nothing for you here...

207
00:24:16,324 --> 00:24:18,417
only death.

208
00:24:38,974 --> 00:24:41,674
[Sindarin] <i>Ah im, ú-’erin veleth lîn?</i>
[English] And I, I-have-not love your?

209
00:24:43,674 --> 00:24:46,074
[Sindarin] <i>Gerich veleth nîn, ada.</i>
[English] You-have my love, father.

210
00:25:36,874 --> 00:25:39,871
[Sindarin] <i>I amar prestar aen.</i>
[English] The world is changed.

211
00:25:40,524 --> 00:25:42,524
[Sindarin] <i>Han mathon ne nen.</i>
[English] I feel it in the water.

212
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:44,974
[Sindarin] <i>Han mathon ne chae.</i>
[English] I feel it in the earth.

213
00:25:46,874 --> 00:25:50,774
[Sindarin] <i>A han noston ned ’wilith.</i>
[English] I smell it in the air.

214
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:55,513
The power of the enemy is growing.

215
00:25:55,689 --> 00:25:58,316
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman...

216
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,858
to destroy the people of Rohan.

217
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:07,558
Isengard has been unleashed.

218
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:15,271
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor...

219
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,376
the last free kingdom of Men.

220
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:23,981
His war on this country will come swiftly.

221
00:26:27,685 --> 00:26:30,779
He senses the Ring is close.

222
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:34,414
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.

223
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:38,654
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand...

224
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:44,066
the quest will claim his life.

225
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:46,397
You know this.

226
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,871
You have foreseen it.

227
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:55,412
It is the risk we all took.

228
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:03,950
In the gathering dark, the
will of the Ring grows strong.

229
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:09,561
It works hard now to find its
way back into the hands of Men.

230
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:15,188
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.

231
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,962
The young captain of Gondor
has but to extend his hand...

232
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:23,231
take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.

233
00:27:25,678 --> 00:27:27,508
It is close now.

234
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,945
So close to achieving its goal.

235
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:38,683
For Sauron will have dominion
over all life on this Earth...

236
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:42,986
even unto to the ending of the world.

237
00:27:44,828 --> 00:27:46,660
The time of the Elves...

238
00:27:46,863 --> 00:27:48,798
is over.

239
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:53,229
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?

240
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:58,470
Do we let them stand alone?

241
00:28:03,013 --> 00:28:04,378
What news?

242
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:07,347
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.

243
00:28:07,518 --> 00:28:10,385
Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.

244
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:14,582
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

245
00:28:14,758 --> 00:28:17,158
Sauron is marshaling an army.

246
00:28:17,494 --> 00:28:19,621
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.

247
00:28:19,797 --> 00:28:23,198
- How many?
- Some thousands. More come every day.

248
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:27,862
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

249
00:28:28,071 --> 00:28:31,097
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.

250
00:28:33,243 --> 00:28:35,438
Saruman attacks from Isengard.

251
00:28:35,612 --> 00:28:38,308
Sauron from Mordor.

252
00:28:39,616 --> 00:28:42,847
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.

253
00:28:43,018 --> 00:28:44,713
Gondor is weak.

254
00:28:44,888 --> 00:28:48,015
Sauron will strike us soon.

255
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:50,623
And he will strike hard.

256
00:28:51,061 --> 00:28:55,157
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.

257
00:29:09,044 --> 00:29:11,274
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

258
00:29:11,447 --> 00:29:14,177
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

259
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,614
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?

260
00:29:23,492 --> 00:29:25,221
Speak.

261
00:29:26,327 --> 00:29:28,921
We are Hobbits of the Shire.

262
00:29:29,264 --> 00:29:32,291
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.

263
00:29:32,735 --> 00:29:34,225
Your bodyguard?

264
00:29:34,437 --> 00:29:36,200
His gardener.

265
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:38,807
And where is your skulking friend?

266
00:29:40,342 --> 00:29:42,640
That gangrel creature.

267
00:29:42,978 --> 00:29:44,945
He had an ill-favored look.

268
00:29:46,681 --> 00:29:48,581
There was no other.

269
00:29:52,687 --> 00:29:55,020
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.

270
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:01,419
One we lost in Moria...

271
00:30:02,497 --> 00:30:04,021
two were my kin...

272
00:30:04,199 --> 00:30:07,930
a Dwarf there was also. And an Elf and two Men.

273
00:30:08,136 --> 00:30:12,038
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.

274
00:30:17,045 --> 00:30:18,808
You're a friend of Boromir?

275
00:30:21,249 --> 00:30:22,739
Yes.

276
00:30:23,818 --> 00:30:24,910
For my part.

277
00:30:31,425 --> 00:30:34,360
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.

278
00:30:36,396 --> 00:30:37,864
Dead?

279
00:30:38,066 --> 00:30:40,090
How? When?

280
00:30:40,367 --> 00:30:42,994
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.

281
00:30:43,336 --> 00:30:47,171
If something has happened to
Boromir, we would have you tell us.

282
00:30:49,911 --> 00:30:56,372
His horn washed up upon the
riverbank, about six days past.

283
00:30:56,583 --> 00:30:59,677
It was cloven in two.

284
00:31:01,287 --> 00:31:04,688
But more than this, I know it in my heart.

285
00:31:06,727 --> 00:31:08,524
He was my brother.

286
00:31:57,975 --> 00:32:00,445
Boromir!

287
00:32:00,979 --> 00:32:02,845
Boromir!

288
00:32:07,085 --> 00:32:10,851
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.

289
00:32:11,022 --> 00:32:14,685
A place of light and beauty and music.

290
00:32:14,859 --> 00:32:17,191
And so it shall be once more!

291
00:32:19,765 --> 00:32:22,393
Let the armies of Mordor know this:

292
00:32:22,602 --> 00:32:26,969
Never again will the land of
my people fall into enemy hands.

293
00:32:30,775 --> 00:32:36,441
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!

294
00:32:36,815 --> 00:32:38,782
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

295
00:32:38,949 --> 00:32:41,782
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

296
00:32:50,494 --> 00:32:53,259
Good speech. Nice and short.

297
00:32:53,465 --> 00:32:56,365
Leaves more time for drinking!

298
00:32:56,667 --> 00:33:00,865
Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!

299
00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:06,470
Remember today, little brother.

300
00:33:06,644 --> 00:33:09,636
Today, life is good.

301
00:33:13,817 --> 00:33:15,409
What?

302
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:17,253
He's here.

303
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:22,289
One moment of peace, can he not give us that?

304
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:23,482
Where is he?

305
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:27,118
Where is Gondor's finest? Where's my first-born?

306
00:33:27,697 --> 00:33:29,392
Father!

307
00:33:34,271 --> 00:33:36,637
They say you vanquished the
enemy almost single-handedly.

308
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:40,207
They exaggerate. The victory belongs to Faramir also.

309
00:33:41,678 --> 00:33:44,579
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.

310
00:33:45,381 --> 00:33:47,679
Were you not entrusted to protect it?

311
00:33:47,851 --> 00:33:49,876
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.

312
00:33:50,053 --> 00:33:51,748
Oh, too few.

313
00:33:52,256 --> 00:33:54,655
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.

314
00:33:56,858 --> 00:33:59,851
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.

315
00:34:00,063 --> 00:34:02,292
That is not my intent.

316
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:06,264
You give him no credit, and
yet he tries to do your will.

317
00:34:09,638 --> 00:34:12,539
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir...

318
00:34:12,709 --> 00:34:15,472
I know his uses, and they are few.

319
00:34:15,645 --> 00:34:19,239
We have more urgent things to speak of.

320
00:34:20,416 --> 00:34:22,849
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.

321
00:34:23,018 --> 00:34:25,885
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.

322
00:34:26,054 --> 00:34:29,854
It is rumored that the weapon
of the enemy has been found.

323
00:34:32,094 --> 00:34:34,358
The One Ring.

324
00:34:37,133 --> 00:34:41,796
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.

325
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:45,599
Everyone will try to claim it: Men, Dwarves, wizards.

326
00:34:45,774 --> 00:34:49,904
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.

327
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:54,374
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.

328
00:34:54,549 --> 00:34:58,245
Ever the Ring will seek to
corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.

329
00:34:58,419 --> 00:35:02,322
But you, you are strong. And our need is great.

330
00:35:02,491 --> 00:35:07,792
It is our blood which is being
spilled, our people who are dying.

331
00:35:07,995 --> 00:35:13,023
Sauron is biding his time. He's massing fresh armies.

332
00:35:13,234 --> 00:35:14,701
He will return.

333
00:35:14,902 --> 00:35:18,634
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.

334
00:35:18,806 --> 00:35:21,367
You must go.

335
00:35:22,542 --> 00:35:24,636
Bring me back this mighty gift.

336
00:35:25,478 --> 00:35:30,974
No. My place is here with my people. Not in Rivendell.

337
00:35:31,152 --> 00:35:34,849
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...

338
00:35:35,022 --> 00:35:37,990
- send me in his stead.
- You?

339
00:35:39,193 --> 00:35:41,127
Oh, I see.

340
00:35:41,294 --> 00:35:45,492
A chance for Faramir, captain
of Gondor, to show his quality.

341
00:35:45,932 --> 00:35:47,901
I think not.

342
00:35:48,101 --> 00:35:50,969
I trust this mission only to your brother.

343
00:35:51,138 --> 00:35:54,038
The one who will not fail me.

344
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:14,288
Remember today, little brother.

345
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,670
Captain Faramir!

346
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:38,076
We found the third one.

347
00:36:49,596 --> 00:36:51,564
You must come with me. Now.

348
00:37:02,775 --> 00:37:03,867
Down there.

349
00:37:18,791 --> 00:37:21,691
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.

350
00:37:32,304 --> 00:37:33,794
They wait for my command.

351
00:37:39,278 --> 00:37:40,370
Shall I shoot?

352
00:37:41,613 --> 00:37:44,639
The rock and pool Is nice and cool

353
00:37:44,816 --> 00:37:46,647
So juicy sweet

354
00:37:47,286 --> 00:37:50,255
Our only wish To catch a fish

355
00:37:50,423 --> 00:37:53,117
So juicy sweet

356
00:38:00,098 --> 00:38:01,496
Wait.

357
00:38:03,001 --> 00:38:05,833
This creature is bound to me.

358
00:38:06,437 --> 00:38:08,371
And I to him.

359
00:38:11,642 --> 00:38:12,940
He is our guide.

360
00:38:17,683 --> 00:38:19,082
Please...

361
00:38:19,251 --> 00:38:21,115
let me go down to him.

362
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:34,091
Smeagol.

363
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:37,328
Master is here.

364
00:38:38,535 --> 00:38:39,661
Come, Smeagol.

365
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:45,168
Trust master. Come.

366
00:38:48,346 --> 00:38:52,179
We must go now?

367
00:38:52,549 --> 00:38:55,986
Smeagol, you must trust master.

368
00:38:56,152 --> 00:38:57,551
Follow me. Come on.

369
00:38:58,788 --> 00:39:00,278
Come.

370
00:39:02,827 --> 00:39:03,986
Come, Smeagol.

371
00:39:04,528 --> 00:39:06,552
Nice Smeagol. That's it.

372
00:39:07,097 --> 00:39:08,587
Come on.

373
00:39:13,036 --> 00:39:14,697
Don't hurt him!

374
00:39:14,872 --> 00:39:17,601
Smeagol, don't struggle. Smeagol, listen to me.

375
00:39:17,774 --> 00:39:19,072
Master!

376
00:40:03,493 --> 00:40:08,260
Why does it cry, Smeagol?

377
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:12,126
Cruel Men hurts us.

378
00:40:12,335 --> 00:40:15,304
Master tricksed us.

379
00:40:15,505 --> 00:40:19,066
Of course he did.

380
00:40:19,442 --> 00:40:23,139
I told you he was tricksy.

381
00:40:23,312 --> 00:40:26,338
I told you he was false.

382
00:40:26,516 --> 00:40:29,212
Master is our friend.

383
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,751
Our friend.

384
00:40:31,921 --> 00:40:34,082
Master betrayed us.

385
00:40:34,257 --> 00:40:37,249
No. Not its business.

386
00:40:38,327 --> 00:40:40,795
Leave us alone!

387
00:40:40,963 --> 00:40:43,363
Filthy little Hobbitses!

388
00:40:43,533 --> 00:40:45,831
They stole it from us!

389
00:40:46,002 --> 00:40:47,435
No. No.

390
00:40:48,004 --> 00:40:49,631
What did they steal?

391
00:40:51,774 --> 00:40:57,110
My precious!

392
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,377
We have to get out of here.

393
00:41:02,985 --> 00:41:04,953
You go. Go, now.

394
00:41:07,557 --> 00:41:09,422
You can do it.

395
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,327
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.

396
00:41:12,528 --> 00:41:14,291
Just this once.

397
00:41:14,497 --> 00:41:16,226
Put it on.

398
00:41:16,699 --> 00:41:18,690
Disappear.

399
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:20,827
I can't.

400
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,170
You were right, Sam.

401
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,101
You tried to tell me but...

402
00:41:34,817 --> 00:41:36,978
I'm sorry.

403
00:41:41,524 --> 00:41:44,391
The Ring's taking me, Sam.

404
00:41:45,828 --> 00:41:47,455
If I put it on...

405
00:41:47,663 --> 00:41:49,995
he'll find me.

406
00:41:51,667 --> 00:41:53,635
He'll see.

407
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:56,838
Mr. Frodo...

408
00:42:01,711 --> 00:42:05,977
So this is the answer to all the riddles.

409
00:42:08,184 --> 00:42:11,176
Here in the Wild I have you...

410
00:42:11,354 --> 00:42:13,254
two Halflings...

411
00:42:13,422 --> 00:42:16,585
and a host of men at my call.

412
00:42:19,929 --> 00:42:23,387
The Ring of Power within my grasp.

413
00:42:33,109 --> 00:42:36,840
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor...

414
00:42:38,447 --> 00:42:41,473
to show his quality.

415
00:43:02,571 --> 00:43:04,163
No!

416
00:43:07,343 --> 00:43:08,674
Stop it!

417
00:43:08,844 --> 00:43:09,902
Leave him alone.

418
00:43:11,247 --> 00:43:13,738
Don't you understand?

419
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:16,951
He's got to destroy it!

420
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,350
That's where we're going, into Mordor.

421
00:43:20,523 --> 00:43:22,184
To the Mountain of Fire!

422
00:43:23,259 --> 00:43:26,353
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.

423
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:29,531
Please. It's such a burden.

424
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,793
Will you not help him?

425
00:43:35,171 --> 00:43:37,071
Captain?

426
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,970
Prepare to leave.

427
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:47,348
The Ring will go to Gondor.

428
00:44:47,776 --> 00:44:52,576
[Sindarin] <i>Mae carnen, Brego, mellon nîn.</i>
[English] Well done, Brego, my friend.

429
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:02,918
- He's alive!
- Where is he? Where is he?

430
00:45:03,093 --> 00:45:06,153
Get out of the way! I'm going to kill him!

431
00:45:06,363 --> 00:45:10,094
You are the luckiest, the canniest...

432
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:14,293
and the most reckless man I ever knew.

433
00:45:15,005 --> 00:45:16,472
Bless you, laddie.

434
00:45:17,073 --> 00:45:18,802
Gimli, where is the king?

435
00:45:27,777 --> 00:45:29,027
[Sindarin] <i>Le abdollen.</i>
[English] You’re late.

436
00:45:32,589 --> 00:45:33,920
You look terrible.

437
00:46:01,177 --> 00:46:03,777
[Sindarin] <i>Hannon le.</i>
[English] Thank you.

438
00:46:15,665 --> 00:46:17,690
A great host, you say?

439
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:20,563
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?

440
00:46:21,238 --> 00:46:24,230
Ten thousand strong at least.

441
00:46:25,775 --> 00:46:27,208
Ten thousand?

442
00:46:27,644 --> 00:46:30,135
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

443
00:46:32,816 --> 00:46:34,943
To destroy the world of Men.

444
00:46:37,454 --> 00:46:39,445
They will be here by nightfall.

445
00:46:45,295 --> 00:46:46,592
Let them come!

446
00:46:48,131 --> 00:46:50,861
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms...

447
00:46:51,067 --> 00:46:54,195
to be ready for battle by nightfall.

448
00:47:02,379 --> 00:47:05,314
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.

449
00:47:05,482 --> 00:47:07,916
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall...

450
00:47:08,084 --> 00:47:10,814
or set foot inside the Hornburg!

451
00:47:10,987 --> 00:47:13,387
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

452
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:16,185
These are Uruk-hai.

453
00:47:16,359 --> 00:47:19,795
Their armor is thick and their shields broad.

454
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:25,093
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.

455
00:47:25,302 --> 00:47:28,897
I know how to defend my own keep.

456
00:47:35,512 --> 00:47:38,913
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.

457
00:47:39,082 --> 00:47:44,315
Saruman's hordes will pillage
and burn. We've seen it before.

458
00:47:44,521 --> 00:47:47,183
Crops can be resown...

459
00:47:47,357 --> 00:47:50,349
homes rebuilt.

460
00:47:50,961 --> 00:47:53,521
Within these walls...

461
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:55,397
we will outlast them.

462
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,999
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.

463
00:47:58,168 --> 00:47:59,692
They come to destroy its people...

464
00:47:59,836 --> 00:48:02,304
down to the last child.

465
00:48:03,206 --> 00:48:05,470
What would you have me do?

466
00:48:05,642 --> 00:48:07,371
Look at my men.

467
00:48:07,544 --> 00:48:09,273
Their courage hangs by a thread.

468
00:48:11,481 --> 00:48:15,884
If this is to be our end, then I
would have them make such an end...

469
00:48:16,052 --> 00:48:19,078
as to be worthy of remembrance.

470
00:48:22,726 --> 00:48:24,626
Send out riders, my lord.

471
00:48:24,928 --> 00:48:27,795
You must call for aid.

472
00:48:31,101 --> 00:48:33,365
And who will come?

473
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:35,362
Elves?

474
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:37,597
Dwarves?

475
00:48:38,375 --> 00:48:41,242
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.

476
00:48:42,078 --> 00:48:44,342
The old alliances are dead.

477
00:48:44,781 --> 00:48:47,579
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?!

478
00:48:47,751 --> 00:48:49,946
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?!

479
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:54,151
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?!

480
00:48:54,324 --> 00:48:56,258
Where was Gon...?

481
00:48:58,928 --> 00:49:00,828
No, my Lord Aragorn...

482
00:49:02,432 --> 00:49:04,900
we are alone.

483
00:49:11,775 --> 00:49:13,504
Get the women and children into the caves.

484
00:49:13,677 --> 00:49:14,939
We need more time to lay provisions...

485
00:49:15,111 --> 00:49:18,603
There is no time. War is upon us.

486
00:49:18,882 --> 00:49:20,577
Secure the gate.

487
00:49:25,789 --> 00:49:27,882
We Ents have not troubled...

488
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:31,458
about the wars of Men and wizards...

489
00:49:32,228 --> 00:49:35,220
for a very long time.

490
00:49:36,499 --> 00:49:41,266
But now, something is about to happen...

491
00:49:41,438 --> 00:49:43,770
that has not happened...

492
00:49:43,973 --> 00:49:46,441
for an age.

493
00:49:47,644 --> 00:49:49,908
Entmoot.

494
00:49:50,346 --> 00:49:51,335
What's that?

495
00:49:51,748 --> 00:49:54,581
'Tis a gathering.

496
00:49:55,785 --> 00:49:58,345
A gathering of what?

497
00:50:16,306 --> 00:50:18,672
Beech. Oak.

498
00:50:18,842 --> 00:50:20,742
Chestnut. Ash.

499
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:22,978
Good. Good. Good.

500
00:50:23,146 --> 00:50:25,512
Many have come.

501
00:50:33,056 --> 00:50:35,820
Now we must decide if the Ents...

502
00:50:35,992 --> 00:50:38,552
will go to war.

503
00:50:47,537 --> 00:50:50,597
Move back! Move to the caves!

504
00:50:53,076 --> 00:50:55,135
Come on, people! Quickly, now!

505
00:50:55,545 --> 00:50:57,843
We'll place the reserves along the wall.

506
00:50:58,014 --> 00:51:00,244
They can support the archers from above the gate.

507
00:51:00,416 --> 00:51:03,544
Aragorn, you must rest.

508
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,120
You're no use to us half alive.

509
00:51:06,589 --> 00:51:07,783
Aragorn!

510
00:51:11,194 --> 00:51:14,220
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.

511
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:16,057
That is an honorable charge.

512
00:51:16,266 --> 00:51:19,133
To mind the children, to find food
and bedding when the men return.

513
00:51:19,302 --> 00:51:20,997
What renown is there in that?

514
00:51:21,171 --> 00:51:24,868
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.

515
00:51:25,141 --> 00:51:27,939
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?

516
00:51:28,111 --> 00:51:33,105
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.

517
00:51:33,416 --> 00:51:36,214
You do not command the others to stay!

518
00:51:36,386 --> 00:51:40,152
They fight beside you because
they would not be parted from you.

519
00:51:41,324 --> 00:51:43,519
Because they love you.

520
00:51:50,667 --> 00:51:52,157
I'm sorry.

521
00:52:58,101 --> 00:53:01,332
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

522
00:53:02,405 --> 00:53:04,202
These are no soldiers.

523
00:53:06,476 --> 00:53:09,934
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.

524
00:53:13,883 --> 00:53:16,784
Look at them. They're frightened.

525
00:53:16,953 --> 00:53:18,420
I can see it in their eyes.

526
00:53:23,277 --> 00:53:25,277
[Sindarin] <i>Boe a hyn...</i>
[English] And they should be...

527
00:53:25,777 --> 00:53:28,277
[Sindarin] <i>Neled herain... dan caer menig.</i>
[English] Three hundred... against ten thousand.

528
00:53:30,577 --> 00:53:32,777
[Sindarin] <i>Si, beriathar hyn ammaeg na ned Edoras.</i>
[English] Here they-will-defend them-selves sharper than at Edoras.

529
00:53:32,777 --> 00:53:36,277
[Sindarin] <i>Aragorn, nedin dagor hen ú-’erir ortheri.</i>
[English] Aragorn, in this battle they can not win.

530
00:53:37,777 --> 00:53:39,027
[Sindarin] <i>Natha daged dhaer</i>
[English] It will be great slaying.

531
00:53:39,409 --> 00:53:41,604
Then I shall die as one of them!

532
00:53:48,051 --> 00:53:49,882
Let him go, lad.

533
00:53:50,453 --> 00:53:52,421
Let him be.

534
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:59,352
Every villager able to wield a
sword has been sent to the armory.

535
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,500
My lord?

536
00:54:07,571 --> 00:54:10,131
Who am I, Gamling?

537
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:17,412
You are our king, sire.

538
00:54:20,417 --> 00:54:23,682
And do you trust your king?

539
00:54:25,222 --> 00:54:28,385
Your men, my lord...

540
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:31,357
will follow you to whatever end.

541
00:54:38,268 --> 00:54:40,168
To whatever end.

542
00:54:50,014 --> 00:54:53,575
Where is the horse and the rider?

543
00:54:53,751 --> 00:54:56,811
Where is the horn that was blowing?

544
00:54:58,322 --> 00:55:02,691
They have passed like rain on the mountains.

545
00:55:03,694 --> 00:55:06,925
Like wind in the meadow.

546
00:55:10,634 --> 00:55:14,400
The days have gone down in the West...

547
00:55:15,105 --> 00:55:17,733
behind the hills...

548
00:55:19,643 --> 00:55:21,270
into Shadow.

549
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:33,156
How did it come to this?

550
00:55:54,478 --> 00:55:56,343
It's been going for hours.

551
00:55:57,481 --> 00:55:59,847
They must have decided something by now.

552
00:56:00,017 --> 00:56:04,113
Decided? No.

553
00:56:04,288 --> 00:56:09,419
We only just finished saying...

554
00:56:10,627 --> 00:56:12,492
good morning.

555
00:56:13,864 --> 00:56:17,027
But it's nighttime already.

556
00:56:17,234 --> 00:56:19,031
You can't take forever.

557
00:56:20,037 --> 00:56:22,062
Don't be hasty.

558
00:56:22,539 --> 00:56:24,939
We're running out of time!

559
00:56:27,945 --> 00:56:30,914
Move! Move to the outer wall.

560
00:56:48,499 --> 00:56:49,796
Give me your sword.

561
00:56:59,309 --> 00:57:00,435
What is your name?

562
00:57:00,978 --> 00:57:03,344
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.

563
00:57:05,482 --> 00:57:08,110
The men are saying we will not live out the night.

564
00:57:10,087 --> 00:57:12,055
They say that it is hopeless.

565
00:57:29,907 --> 00:57:31,534
This is a good sword.

566
00:57:33,577 --> 00:57:35,909
Haleth, son of Hama...

567
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:42,411
there is always hope.

568
00:58:05,342 --> 00:58:08,709
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

569
00:58:08,879 --> 00:58:10,437
Forgive me.

570
00:58:10,614 --> 00:58:12,047
I was wrong to despair.

571
00:58:14,978 --> 00:58:16,978
[Sindarin] <i>Ú-moe edaved, Legolas</i>
[English] There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.

572
00:58:21,258 --> 00:58:24,056
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

573
00:58:27,531 --> 00:58:29,556
It's a little tight across the chest.

574
00:58:35,772 --> 00:58:37,740
That is no Orc horn.

575
00:58:43,413 --> 00:58:45,244
Send for the king.

576
00:58:45,415 --> 00:58:49,010
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!

577
00:59:20,651 --> 00:59:22,312
How is this possible?

578
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:26,949
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

579
00:59:27,124 --> 00:59:30,355
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.

580
00:59:31,061 --> 00:59:35,293
Long ago we fought and died together.

581
00:59:37,601 --> 00:59:40,278
We come to honor that allegiance.

582
00:59:40,778 --> 00:59:43,278
[Sindarin] <i>Mae govannen, Haldir.</i>
[English] Well-met, Haldir.

583
00:59:48,979 --> 00:59:50,913
You are most welcome.

584
00:59:56,286 --> 01:00:00,222
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.

585
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:37,155
You could have picked a better spot.

586
01:00:42,065 --> 01:00:46,229
Well, lad, whatever luck you live
by, let's hope it lasts the night.

587
01:00:52,409 --> 01:00:54,206
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

588
01:00:54,845 --> 01:00:57,336
Let's hope they last the night.

589
01:01:57,278 --> 01:02:00,278
[Sindarin] <i>A Eruchîn, ú-dano i faelas a hyn...</i>
[English] O Children-of-Eru, don’t show mercy to them...

590
01:02:01,578 --> 01:02:04,578
[Sindarin] <i>...an uben tanatha le faelas!</i>
[English] ...for nobody will show you mercy!

591
01:02:38,748 --> 01:02:41,546
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?

592
01:02:42,819 --> 01:02:44,616
Or would you like me to find you a box?

593
01:03:23,779 --> 01:03:25,779
[Sindarin] <i>Dartho!</i>
[English] Hold!

594
01:03:47,818 --> 01:03:49,615
So it begins.

595
01:03:55,279 --> 01:03:57,279
[Sindarin] <i>Tangado a chadad!</i>
[English] Prepare to fire!

596
01:04:04,779 --> 01:04:06,779
[Sindarin] <i>Faeg i-varv dîn na lanc...</i>
[English] Their armour is poor below the neck...

597
01:04:07,279 --> 01:04:09,279
[Sindarin] <i>...a nu ranc!</i>
[English] ...and under arm!

598
01:04:09,529 --> 01:04:11,529
[Sindarin] <i>Hado i philinn!</i>
[English] Release the arrows!

599
01:04:16,447 --> 01:04:17,812
Did they hit anything?

600
01:04:18,482 --> 01:04:20,473
Give them a volley.

601
01:04:20,651 --> 01:04:22,744
- Fire!
- Fire!

602
01:04:38,502 --> 01:04:40,197
Send them to me! Come on!

603
01:04:59,279 --> 01:05:00,879
[Sindarin] <i>Pendraith!</i>
[English] Ladders!

604
01:05:00,891 --> 01:05:01,983
Good!

605
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:11,768
Swords! Swords!

606
01:05:49,907 --> 01:05:52,034
Legolas! Two already!

607
01:05:52,209 --> 01:05:54,336
I'm on 17!

608
01:05:54,512 --> 01:05:57,072
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!

609
01:06:03,821 --> 01:06:05,550
Nineteen!

610
01:06:31,549 --> 01:06:32,982
Merry.

611
01:06:37,388 --> 01:06:41,188
We have just agreed.

612
01:06:51,235 --> 01:06:52,702
Yes?

613
01:06:54,205 --> 01:06:58,369
I have told your names to the Entmoot...

614
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:02,673
and we have agreed...

615
01:07:03,147 --> 01:07:07,174
you are not Orcs.

616
01:07:08,919 --> 01:07:11,046
Well, that's good news.

617
01:07:11,222 --> 01:07:15,352
And what about Saruman? Have
you come to a decision about him?

618
01:07:15,993 --> 01:07:19,793
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.

619
01:07:19,964 --> 01:07:21,488
Hasty?

620
01:07:22,299 --> 01:07:24,199
Our friends are out there.

621
01:07:24,368 --> 01:07:28,532
They need our help. They cannot
fight this war on their own.

622
01:07:28,873 --> 01:07:31,137
War? Yes.

623
01:07:31,308 --> 01:07:33,208
It affects us all.

624
01:07:33,377 --> 01:07:36,369
Tree, root and twig.

625
01:07:37,248 --> 01:07:41,275
But you must understand, young Hobbit...

626
01:07:41,485 --> 01:07:43,419
it takes a long time...

627
01:07:43,587 --> 01:07:48,490
to say anything in Old Entish...

628
01:07:48,659 --> 01:07:52,891
and we never say anything...

629
01:07:53,063 --> 01:07:56,999
unless it is worth taking...

630
01:07:57,168 --> 01:08:01,127
a long time to say.

631
01:08:01,939 --> 01:08:05,238
Seventeen! Eighteen!

632
01:08:05,409 --> 01:08:06,467
Nineteen!

633
01:08:07,044 --> 01:08:08,909
Twenty!

634
01:08:09,079 --> 01:08:10,740
Twenty-one!

635
01:08:20,825 --> 01:08:21,816
Causeway!

636
01:08:21,825 --> 01:08:23,116
[Sindarin] <i>Na fennas!</i>
[English] To gateway!

637
01:08:23,179 --> 01:08:25,679
[Sindarin] <i>Hado ribed! Hado!</i>
[English] Hurl to flow! Hurl!

638
01:08:30,634 --> 01:08:33,000
Is this it?

639
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:36,105
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?

640
01:09:02,279 --> 01:09:04,279
[Sindarin] <i>Togo hon dad, Legolas!</i>
[English] Bring him down, Legolas!

641
01:09:06,779 --> 01:09:07,779
[Sindarin] <i>Dago hon!</i>
[English] Kill him!

642
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:09,779
[Sindarin] <i>Dago hon!</i>
[English] Kill him!

643
01:10:02,092 --> 01:10:03,457
Brace the gate!

644
01:10:21,812 --> 01:10:24,076
Hold them! Stand firm!

645
01:10:31,956 --> 01:10:33,287
Aragorn!

646
01:10:37,928 --> 01:10:39,122
Gimli!

647
01:10:45,479 --> 01:10:46,979
[Sindarin] <i>Hado i philinn!</i>
[English] Release the arrows!

648
01:10:49,779 --> 01:10:51,779
[Sindarin] <i>Herio!</i>
[English] Charge!

649
01:11:27,878 --> 01:11:31,814
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

650
01:11:32,583 --> 01:11:36,610
We must weather such things as we have always done.

651
01:11:37,421 --> 01:11:39,514
How can that be your decision?!

652
01:11:40,190 --> 01:11:43,819
This is not our war.

653
01:11:44,128 --> 01:11:46,323
But you're part of this world!

654
01:11:50,501 --> 01:11:52,332
Aren't you?!

655
01:11:56,408 --> 01:11:58,774
You must help. Please.

656
01:12:00,011 --> 01:12:02,775
You must do something.

657
01:12:03,048 --> 01:12:07,348
You are young and brave, Master Merry.

658
01:12:08,553 --> 01:12:12,284
But your part in this tale is over.

659
01:12:12,457 --> 01:12:14,687
Go back to your home.

660
01:12:24,736 --> 01:12:27,000
Maybe Treebeard's right.

661
01:12:27,172 --> 01:12:29,037
We don't belong here, Merry.

662
01:12:29,207 --> 01:12:31,471
It's too big for us.

663
01:12:31,643 --> 01:12:34,305
What can we do in the end?

664
01:12:36,614 --> 01:12:39,242
We've got the Shire.

665
01:12:39,784 --> 01:12:42,309
Maybe we should go home.

666
01:12:44,155 --> 01:12:47,386
The fires of Isengard will spread...

667
01:12:47,559 --> 01:12:52,462
and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.

668
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:54,222
And...

669
01:12:56,067 --> 01:12:59,093
And all that was once green and
good in this world will be gone.

670
01:13:02,607 --> 01:13:05,542
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

671
01:13:25,063 --> 01:13:26,291
Aragorn!

672
01:13:26,464 --> 01:13:28,830
Fall back to the Keep!

673
01:13:29,033 --> 01:13:32,093
Get your men out of there!

674
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,280
[Sindarin] <i>Nan barad!</i>
[English] To tower!

675
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,280
[Sindarin] <i>Nan barad!</i>
[English] To tower!

676
01:13:41,779 --> 01:13:43,440
Haldir!

677
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:47,280
[Sindarin] <i>Nan barad!</i>
[English] To tower!

678
01:13:47,552 --> 01:13:50,817
What are you doing? What are you stopping for?

679
01:14:10,008 --> 01:14:11,236
Haldir!

680
01:14:53,952 --> 01:14:55,442
Brace the gate!

681
01:14:57,689 --> 01:14:58,986
Hold them!

682
01:15:00,758 --> 01:15:04,125
To the gate. Draw your swords!

683
01:15:32,290 --> 01:15:34,224
Make way!

684
01:15:37,128 --> 01:15:38,857
We cannot hold much longer!

685
01:15:44,869 --> 01:15:48,396
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?

686
01:15:48,606 --> 01:15:51,166
As long as you can give me.

687
01:15:51,342 --> 01:15:53,003
Gimli!

688
01:15:54,479 --> 01:15:55,844
Timbers!

689
01:15:56,014 --> 01:15:57,982
Brace the gate!

690
01:16:12,697 --> 01:16:14,392
Come on. We can take them.

691
01:16:15,266 --> 01:16:16,858
It's a long way.

692
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:23,903
Toss me.

693
01:16:25,076 --> 01:16:26,907
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!

694
01:16:27,078 --> 01:16:28,636
You'll have to toss me!

695
01:16:34,252 --> 01:16:35,514
Don't tell the Elf.

696
01:16:36,054 --> 01:16:37,817
Not a word.

697
01:16:53,104 --> 01:16:54,537
Shore up the door!

698
01:16:54,706 --> 01:16:56,799
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.

699
01:16:56,974 --> 01:16:58,032
Watch our backs!

700
01:17:02,113 --> 01:17:04,343
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!

701
01:17:54,332 --> 01:17:55,731
Hold fast the gate!

702
01:17:59,937 --> 01:18:02,872
Gimli! Aragorn! Get out of there!

703
01:18:07,612 --> 01:18:09,204
Aragorn!

704
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:45,114
Pull everybody back.

705
01:18:45,483 --> 01:18:47,280
Pull them back.

706
01:18:47,819 --> 01:18:49,286
Fall back!

707
01:18:49,454 --> 01:18:51,945
Fall back!

708
01:18:53,124 --> 01:18:54,819
They have broken through!

709
01:18:54,992 --> 01:18:57,256
The castle is breached. Retreat!

710
01:18:57,428 --> 01:18:59,658
- Fall back!
- Retreat!

711
01:18:59,764 --> 01:19:02,358
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!

712
01:19:02,567 --> 01:19:04,797
Into the Keep!

713
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:21,240
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.

714
01:19:21,419 --> 01:19:26,118
You can make your way north
to your homeland from there.

715
01:19:31,863 --> 01:19:33,125
Wait! Stop!

716
01:19:34,031 --> 01:19:35,521
Stop!

717
01:19:38,669 --> 01:19:40,364
Turn around.

718
01:19:41,305 --> 01:19:44,001
- Turn around. Take us south.
- South?

719
01:19:44,175 --> 01:19:49,169
But that will lead you past Isengard.

720
01:19:49,514 --> 01:19:52,210
Yes. Exactly.

721
01:19:52,383 --> 01:19:55,614
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.

722
01:19:55,786 --> 01:19:58,448
The closer we are to danger,
the farther we are from harm.

723
01:19:58,623 --> 01:20:00,614
It's the last thing he'll expect.

724
01:20:03,227 --> 01:20:06,253
That doesn't make sense to me.

725
01:20:06,430 --> 01:20:07,590
But then...

726
01:20:07,798 --> 01:20:10,460
you are very small.

727
01:20:10,968 --> 01:20:12,697
Perhaps you're right.

728
01:20:15,373 --> 01:20:16,863
South it is, then.

729
01:20:18,409 --> 01:20:21,742
Hold on, little Shirelings.

730
01:20:23,781 --> 01:20:26,545
I always like going south.

731
01:20:26,717 --> 01:20:31,017
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

732
01:20:31,622 --> 01:20:34,090
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

733
01:20:34,258 --> 01:20:36,192
No, we won't.

734
01:20:36,928 --> 01:20:39,192
Not this time.

735
01:20:45,870 --> 01:20:46,859
Look!

736
01:20:48,539 --> 01:20:50,973
Osgiliath burns!

737
01:20:51,142 --> 01:20:52,576
Mordor has come.

738
01:20:53,712 --> 01:20:56,112
The Ring will not save Gondor.

739
01:20:57,449 --> 01:20:59,644
It has only the power to destroy.

740
01:21:00,485 --> 01:21:01,918
Please...

741
01:21:02,087 --> 01:21:03,714
let me go.

742
01:21:04,756 --> 01:21:06,348
Hurry.

743
01:21:09,828 --> 01:21:11,227
Faramir!

744
01:21:11,396 --> 01:21:13,887
You must let me go!

745
01:21:14,333 --> 01:21:17,791
And those little family of field mice...

746
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:20,803
that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.

747
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:24,839
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...

748
01:21:36,021 --> 01:21:38,956
Many of these trees were my friends.

749
01:21:39,658 --> 01:21:44,288
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.

750
01:21:45,464 --> 01:21:46,658
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

751
01:21:46,832 --> 01:21:49,596
They had voices of their own.

752
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:54,395
Saruman.

753
01:21:54,773 --> 01:21:57,833
A wizard should know better!

754
01:22:12,057 --> 01:22:15,686
There is no curse in Elvish...

755
01:22:15,894 --> 01:22:18,556
Entish or the tongues of Men...

756
01:22:18,730 --> 01:22:21,062
for this treachery.

757
01:22:22,501 --> 01:22:25,334
Look! The trees! They're moving!

758
01:22:30,042 --> 01:22:31,236
Where are they going?

759
01:22:31,777 --> 01:22:35,008
They have business with the Orcs.

760
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:39,746
My business is with Isengard tonight...

761
01:22:39,918 --> 01:22:42,546
with rock and stone.

762
01:23:06,445 --> 01:23:07,571
Yes.

763
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:10,113
Come, my friends.

764
01:23:11,450 --> 01:23:15,648
The Ents are going to war.

765
01:23:15,821 --> 01:23:17,584
It is likely...

766
01:23:17,756 --> 01:23:21,283
that we go to our doom.

767
01:23:22,694 --> 01:23:25,162
Last march...

768
01:23:25,697 --> 01:23:27,722
of the Ents.

769
01:24:15,847 --> 01:24:19,578
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern
shore. Their numbers are too great.

770
01:24:19,751 --> 01:24:21,810
By nightfall we will be overrun.

771
01:24:24,589 --> 01:24:26,056
Mr. Frodo?

772
01:24:26,358 --> 01:24:30,454
It's calling to him, Sam. His Eye is almost on me.

773
01:24:30,629 --> 01:24:33,120
Hold on, Mr. Frodo. You'll be all right.

774
01:24:47,479 --> 01:24:48,878
Take them to my father.

775
01:24:50,448 --> 01:24:53,440
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.

776
01:24:55,854 --> 01:24:58,880
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.

777
01:24:59,991 --> 01:25:02,687
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?

778
01:25:03,328 --> 01:25:06,092
You want to know why your brother died?

779
01:25:06,598 --> 01:25:10,329
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

780
01:25:10,535 --> 01:25:12,435
He tried to kill him!

781
01:25:12,604 --> 01:25:14,936
The Ring drove your brother mad!

782
01:25:15,707 --> 01:25:17,572
Watch out!

783
01:25:28,486 --> 01:25:29,612
Mr. Frodo?

784
01:25:32,257 --> 01:25:34,088
They're here.

785
01:25:37,195 --> 01:25:39,663
They've come.

786
01:25:42,267 --> 01:25:44,167
Nazgul!

787
01:26:06,224 --> 01:26:08,385
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

788
01:26:10,195 --> 01:26:12,425
Take cover!

789
01:26:29,781 --> 01:26:31,339
The fortress is taken.

790
01:26:32,117 --> 01:26:33,311
It is over.

791
01:26:33,485 --> 01:26:37,421
You said this fortress would never
fall while your men defend it.

792
01:26:37,589 --> 01:26:40,524
They still defend it. They have died defending it.

793
01:26:43,261 --> 01:26:44,660
They're breaking in!

794
01:26:47,299 --> 01:26:49,790
They're past the door!

795
01:26:53,171 --> 01:26:57,301
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

796
01:26:59,911 --> 01:27:01,845
Is there no other way?

797
01:27:03,415 --> 01:27:06,475
There is one passage. It leads into the mountains.

798
01:27:07,152 --> 01:27:09,347
But they will not get far. The Uruk-hai are too many.

799
01:27:14,225 --> 01:27:16,625
Tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass.

800
01:27:16,795 --> 01:27:19,662
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.

801
01:27:21,866 --> 01:27:25,267
What can Men do against such reckless hate?

802
01:27:29,941 --> 01:27:31,374
Ride out with me.

803
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:37,107
Ride out and meet them.

804
01:27:37,882 --> 01:27:40,043
For death and glory.

805
01:27:40,218 --> 01:27:41,617
For Rohan.

806
01:27:43,121 --> 01:27:44,588
For your people.

807
01:27:45,323 --> 01:27:47,257
The sun is rising.

808
01:27:51,763 --> 01:27:54,755
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.

809
01:27:54,933 --> 01:27:56,332
At dawn...

810
01:27:56,534 --> 01:27:58,195
look to the east.

811
01:28:02,374 --> 01:28:04,001
Yes.

812
01:28:06,478 --> 01:28:08,139
Yes.

813
01:28:09,481 --> 01:28:11,881
The horn of Helm Hammerhand...

814
01:28:12,050 --> 01:28:14,848
shall sound in the Deep...

815
01:28:15,286 --> 01:28:17,277
one last time.

816
01:28:17,455 --> 01:28:18,945
Yes!

817
01:28:21,993 --> 01:28:25,793
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.

818
01:28:33,605 --> 01:28:34,936
Fell deeds, awake.

819
01:28:36,141 --> 01:28:37,199
Now for wrath...

820
01:28:37,409 --> 01:28:40,810
now for ruin and a red dawn.

821
01:28:47,752 --> 01:28:50,016
[Rohirric] <i>Forð Eorlingas!</i>
[English] Forth Eorlingas!

822
01:29:37,902 --> 01:29:39,096
Gandalf.

823
01:29:46,411 --> 01:29:50,075
Theoden King stands alone.

824
01:29:50,683 --> 01:29:52,844
Not alone.

825
01:29:53,252 --> 01:29:54,378
Rohirrim!

826
01:30:00,292 --> 01:30:01,452
Eomer.

827
01:30:01,627 --> 01:30:04,152
To the king!

828
01:31:21,807 --> 01:31:23,570
Yes!

829
01:31:32,718 --> 01:31:36,154
A hit. A fine hit.

830
01:32:00,679 --> 01:32:03,147
Break the dam!

831
01:32:03,315 --> 01:32:06,751
Release the river!

832
01:32:34,113 --> 01:32:36,843
Pippin! Hold on!

833
01:32:42,121 --> 01:32:45,056
Hold on, little Hobbits.

834
01:33:26,365 --> 01:33:28,390
What are you doing?

835
01:33:37,009 --> 01:33:38,533
Where are you going?

836
01:34:36,735 --> 01:34:38,032
It's me.

837
01:34:40,572 --> 01:34:42,767
It's your Sam.

838
01:34:47,112 --> 01:34:49,740
Don't you know your Sam?

839
01:35:07,399 --> 01:35:10,766
I can't do this, Sam.

840
01:35:11,703 --> 01:35:13,671
I know.

841
01:35:14,706 --> 01:35:17,072
It's all wrong.

842
01:35:17,810 --> 01:35:19,835
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

843
01:35:27,252 --> 01:35:29,345
But we are.

844
01:35:35,761 --> 01:35:38,787
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

845
01:35:38,964 --> 01:35:41,364
The ones that really mattered.

846
01:35:42,401 --> 01:35:45,393
Full of darkness and danger they were.

847
01:35:45,604 --> 01:35:48,573
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end...

848
01:35:48,740 --> 01:35:51,675
because how could the end be happy?

849
01:35:54,246 --> 01:35:56,441
How could the world go back to the way it was...

850
01:35:56,615 --> 01:36:00,051
when so much bad had happened?

851
01:36:00,886 --> 01:36:02,786
Victory!

852
01:36:02,955 --> 01:36:04,513
We have victory!

853
01:36:04,690 --> 01:36:08,626
But in the end, it's only a passing thing...

854
01:36:08,794 --> 01:36:10,125
this shadow.

855
01:36:10,295 --> 01:36:12,695
Even darkness must pass.

856
01:36:12,865 --> 01:36:15,561
A new day will come.

857
01:36:15,767 --> 01:36:19,703
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.

858
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:24,006
Those were the stories that stayed with you...

859
01:36:24,176 --> 01:36:25,939
that meant something.

860
01:36:26,111 --> 01:36:28,671
Even if you were too small to understand why.

861
01:36:30,048 --> 01:36:33,916
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.

862
01:36:34,086 --> 01:36:35,644
I know now.

863
01:36:36,488 --> 01:36:38,683
Folk in those stories...

864
01:36:38,857 --> 01:36:42,987
had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.

865
01:36:43,161 --> 01:36:45,391
They kept going...

866
01:36:46,064 --> 01:36:49,329
because they were holding on to something.

867
01:36:50,969 --> 01:36:53,267
What are we holding on to, Sam?

868
01:37:05,150 --> 01:37:09,086
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.

869
01:37:09,354 --> 01:37:11,982
And it's worth fighting for.

870
01:37:38,917 --> 01:37:43,217
I think at last we understand
one another, Frodo Baggins.

871
01:37:43,956 --> 01:37:47,915
You know the laws of our
country, the laws of your father.

872
01:37:48,093 --> 01:37:50,288
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.

873
01:37:54,666 --> 01:37:56,065
Then it is forfeit.

874
01:37:58,837 --> 01:38:00,532
Release them.

875
01:38:12,618 --> 01:38:14,677
Stay out of the forest!

876
01:38:14,853 --> 01:38:16,650
Keep away from the trees!

877
01:39:07,473 --> 01:39:09,270
Final count...

878
01:39:09,442 --> 01:39:12,343
- 42.
- 42?

879
01:39:13,813 --> 01:39:18,580
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.

880
01:39:19,385 --> 01:39:23,048
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.

881
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:30,459
- 43.
- He was already dead.

882
01:39:31,230 --> 01:39:33,721
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching...

883
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:38,599
because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!

884
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:45,539
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.

885
01:39:45,812 --> 01:39:49,339
Still, I suppose the view would
be quite nice from up there.

886
01:39:49,515 --> 01:39:52,484
Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment.

887
01:39:52,652 --> 01:39:55,485
I hear the staff are very good.

888
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:03,526
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

889
01:40:03,696 --> 01:40:07,962
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.

890
01:40:08,134 --> 01:40:09,362
I'm starving.

891
01:40:09,569 --> 01:40:12,629
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.

892
01:40:12,839 --> 01:40:15,865
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.

893
01:40:39,866 --> 01:40:42,266
Saruman's storeroom!

894
01:40:44,637 --> 01:40:47,333
I don't believe it.

895
01:40:47,540 --> 01:40:49,565
It can't be.

896
01:40:50,209 --> 01:40:53,110
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.

897
01:40:54,413 --> 01:40:56,711
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.

898
01:40:57,083 --> 01:41:00,109
It's perfect. One barrel each.

899
01:41:00,286 --> 01:41:01,412
Wait.

900
01:41:02,155 --> 01:41:03,383
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?

901
01:41:03,556 --> 01:41:05,080
Share it?

902
01:41:06,926 --> 01:41:09,326
No. No.

903
01:41:10,830 --> 01:41:12,161
Dead plant and all that.

904
01:41:12,598 --> 01:41:14,759
Don't think he'd understand.

905
01:41:16,068 --> 01:41:18,229
Could be a distant relative.

906
01:41:19,038 --> 01:41:21,529
I get it.

907
01:41:21,741 --> 01:41:24,539
Don't be hasty.

908
01:41:25,645 --> 01:41:27,408
Exactly.

909
01:41:28,481 --> 01:41:30,745
Bar-hrum.

910
01:41:56,409 --> 01:41:57,706
This is the old sewer.

911
01:41:57,877 --> 01:42:00,937
Runs right under the river
through to the edge of the city.

912
01:42:01,113 --> 01:42:02,842
You'll find cover in the woods there.

913
01:42:03,916 --> 01:42:06,384
Captain Faramir...

914
01:42:07,019 --> 01:42:08,850
you have shown your quality, sir.

915
01:42:11,357 --> 01:42:12,654
The very highest.

916
01:42:13,159 --> 01:42:15,787
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee...

917
01:42:15,962 --> 01:42:18,897
where gardeners are held in high honor.

918
01:42:20,099 --> 01:42:22,067
What road will you take once you reach the woods?

919
01:42:22,702 --> 01:42:24,226
Gollum says there's a path...

920
01:42:24,437 --> 01:42:28,373
near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.

921
01:42:28,841 --> 01:42:30,570
Cirith Ungol?

922
01:42:34,113 --> 01:42:36,673
- Is that its name?
- No.

923
01:42:36,849 --> 01:42:38,510
No!

924
01:42:39,352 --> 01:42:42,344
- Yes.
- Frodo...

925
01:42:42,722 --> 01:42:46,249
they say a dark terror dwells
in the passes above Minas Morgul.

926
01:42:47,159 --> 01:42:49,684
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.

927
01:42:50,029 --> 01:42:56,298
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.

928
01:42:57,837 --> 01:42:59,600
I must.

929
01:43:03,142 --> 01:43:06,703
Go, Frodo. Go with the goodwill of all Men.

930
01:43:06,879 --> 01:43:08,904
Thank you.

931
01:43:20,726 --> 01:43:24,856
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.

932
01:43:37,343 --> 01:43:38,867
Come on, keep up.

933
01:43:42,348 --> 01:43:45,146
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.

934
01:43:45,785 --> 01:43:47,616
You know that, don't you?

935
01:43:48,421 --> 01:43:49,979
He was trying to save you, see?

936
01:43:50,489 --> 01:43:52,013
Save me?

937
01:43:52,358 --> 01:43:54,519
So there's no hard feelings.

938
01:43:54,694 --> 01:43:59,757
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.

939
01:43:59,932 --> 01:44:02,560
Gollum, Gollum.

940
01:44:03,636 --> 01:44:05,365
Yes, master.

941
01:44:06,472 --> 01:44:09,305
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.

942
01:44:09,475 --> 01:44:11,773
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.

943
01:44:17,283 --> 01:44:22,482
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.

944
01:44:29,628 --> 01:44:32,620
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

945
01:44:33,299 --> 01:44:36,826
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.

946
01:44:42,008 --> 01:44:45,444
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits...

947
01:44:46,412 --> 01:44:49,643
somewhere in the wilderness.

948
01:44:52,952 --> 01:44:56,353
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.

949
01:44:56,522 --> 01:44:57,887
What?

950
01:44:58,057 --> 01:45:01,959
I wonder if people will ever say,
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."

951
01:45:02,128 --> 01:45:05,393
And they'll say, "Yes! That's
one of my favorite stories."

952
01:45:05,564 --> 01:45:08,499
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"

953
01:45:08,667 --> 01:45:10,328
"Yes, my boy.

954
01:45:10,536 --> 01:45:14,336
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."

955
01:45:14,507 --> 01:45:16,998
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:

956
01:45:17,209 --> 01:45:19,109
"Samwise the Brave."

957
01:45:19,278 --> 01:45:22,008
I want to hear more about Sam.

958
01:45:26,318 --> 01:45:29,310
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.

959
01:45:30,656 --> 01:45:34,683
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't
make fun. I was being serious.

960
01:45:35,795 --> 01:45:37,160
So was I.

961
01:45:46,072 --> 01:45:48,734
"Samwise the Brave."

962
01:45:53,045 --> 01:45:54,376
Smeagol?

963
01:45:54,547 --> 01:45:57,448
We're not going to wait for you. Come on.

964
01:45:57,616 --> 01:45:59,550
Master.

965
01:45:59,718 --> 01:46:02,619
Master looks after us.

966
01:46:03,389 --> 01:46:06,187
Master wouldn't hurt us.

967
01:46:06,358 --> 01:46:08,826
Master broke his promise.

968
01:46:08,994 --> 01:46:11,155
Don't ask Smeagol.

969
01:46:11,330 --> 01:46:14,527
Poor, poor Smeagol.

970
01:46:14,700 --> 01:46:17,533
Master betrayed us.

971
01:46:17,736 --> 01:46:20,796
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

972
01:46:21,006 --> 01:46:24,908
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.

973
01:46:25,077 --> 01:46:27,807
Kill him! Kill him!

974
01:46:27,980 --> 01:46:29,470
Kill them both!

975
01:46:29,648 --> 01:46:33,277
And then we take the precious...

976
01:46:33,452 --> 01:46:36,979
and we be the master!

977
01:46:37,656 --> 01:46:40,318
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

978
01:46:40,493 --> 01:46:43,155
Eyes always watching.

979
01:46:43,329 --> 01:46:46,890
Then we stabs them out.

980
01:46:47,066 --> 01:46:51,560
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.

981
01:46:51,770 --> 01:46:55,206
Yes. Yes. Yes.

982
01:46:55,407 --> 01:46:58,103
Kill them both.

983
01:46:58,277 --> 01:47:00,677
Yes. No! No!

984
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:04,577
It's too risky. It's too risky.

985
01:47:05,284 --> 01:47:07,878
Where is he? Where has he gone?

986
01:47:08,053 --> 01:47:10,647
- Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
- Smeagol?

987
01:47:10,823 --> 01:47:16,227
We could let her do it.

988
01:47:17,196 --> 01:47:21,326
Yes. She could do it.

989
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:26,062
Yes, precious, she could.

990
01:47:26,272 --> 01:47:32,268
And then we takes it once they're dead.

991
01:47:33,245 --> 01:47:36,078
Once they're dead.

992
01:47:40,486 --> 01:47:44,183
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

993
01:47:44,356 --> 01:47:46,416
Smeagol will show you the way.

994
01:47:46,593 --> 01:47:48,823
Follow me.
