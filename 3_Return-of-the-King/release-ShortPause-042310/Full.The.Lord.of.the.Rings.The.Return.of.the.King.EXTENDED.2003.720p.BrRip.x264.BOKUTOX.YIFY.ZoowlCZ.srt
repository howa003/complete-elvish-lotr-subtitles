5
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,494
Smeagol!

6
00:01:19,421 --> 00:01:21,663
I've got one!

7
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:24,292
I've got a fish, Smea... Smeagol!

8
00:01:24,468 --> 00:01:27,586
Pull it in. Go on. Go on. Go on. Pull it in.

9
00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:37,638
Deagol!

10
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:36,858
Deagol?

11
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:41,651
Deagol.

12
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,544
Give us that, Deagol, my love.

13
00:03:04,516 --> 00:03:05,797
Why?

14
00:03:06,893 --> 00:03:09,135
Because...

15
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:13,060
it's my birthday and I wants it.

16
00:04:47,109 --> 00:04:52,352
My precious.

17
00:04:59,912 --> 00:05:02,829
They cursed us.

18
00:05:02,998 --> 00:05:04,373
Murderer.

19
00:05:04,542 --> 00:05:06,997
"Murderer" they called us.

20
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:11,959
They cursed us and drove us away.

21
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,798
Gollum.

22
00:05:14,966 --> 00:05:16,675
Gollum.

23
00:05:16,844 --> 00:05:18,800
Gollum.

24
00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:25,349
And we wept, precious.

25
00:05:25,517 --> 00:05:29,100
We wept to be so alone.

26
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:35,474
- and cool
- So nice for feet

27
00:05:36,487 --> 00:05:40,863
And we only wish To catch a fish

28
00:05:41,032 --> 00:05:44,282
So juicy sweet

29
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:54,167
And we forgot the taste of bread...

30
00:05:54,335 --> 00:05:57,953
the sound of trees...

31
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:02,043
the softness of the wind.

32
00:06:02,676 --> 00:06:08,346
We even forgot our own name.

33
00:06:16,481 --> 00:06:22,897
My precious.

34
00:07:07,151 --> 00:07:09,392
Wake up!

35
00:07:10,446 --> 00:07:12,106
Wake up!

36
00:07:12,281 --> 00:07:14,073
Wake up, sleepies.

37
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:16,114
We must go, yes.

38
00:07:16,285 --> 00:07:18,954
We must go at once.

39
00:07:22,498 --> 00:07:25,582
Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?

40
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:30,333
I've gone and had too much.

41
00:07:31,715 --> 00:07:33,458
Must be getting late.

42
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:35,128
No.

43
00:07:35,302 --> 00:07:37,210
It isn't.

44
00:07:37,386 --> 00:07:40,422
It isn't midday yet.

45
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:43,171
The days are growing darker.

46
00:07:47,438 --> 00:07:49,645
Come on!

47
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:54,308
Must go! No time!

48
00:07:54,485 --> 00:07:56,857
Not before Mr. Frodo's had something to eat.

49
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:59,900
No time to lose, silly.

50
00:08:08,665 --> 00:08:09,945
Here.

51
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,996
What about you?

52
00:08:15,171 --> 00:08:18,540
Oh, no, I'm not hungry.
Leastways, not for lembas bread.

53
00:08:19,134 --> 00:08:20,508
Sam.

54
00:08:23,095 --> 00:08:24,637
All right.

55
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:27,295
We don't have that much left.

56
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:30,344
We have to be careful or we're going to run out.

57
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,437
You go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.

58
00:08:35,605 --> 00:08:37,016
I've rationed it.

59
00:08:37,524 --> 00:08:39,184
There should be enough.

60
00:08:41,361 --> 00:08:42,559
For what?

61
00:08:44,239 --> 00:08:45,982
The journey home.

62
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:56,155
Come, Hobbitses.

63
00:08:57,542 --> 00:08:59,416
Very close now.

64
00:08:59,586 --> 00:09:02,836
Very close to Mordor.

65
00:09:03,006 --> 00:09:05,674
No safe places here.

66
00:09:05,841 --> 00:09:07,999
Hurry.

67
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,099
It's good.

68
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,761
Definitely from the Shire.

69
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,103
Longbottom Leaf.

70
00:10:14,446 --> 00:10:18,775
I feel like I'm back at The Green Dragon.

71
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:23,116
- Green Dragon.
- A mug of ale in my hand.

72
00:10:23,286 --> 00:10:27,865
Putting my feet up on a settle after a hard day's work.

73
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,909
Only, you've never done a hard day's work.

74
00:10:44,723 --> 00:10:47,759
Welcome, my lords...

75
00:10:47,934 --> 00:10:50,175
to Isengard!

76
00:10:50,561 --> 00:10:54,309
You young rascals! A merry hunt you've led us on...

77
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:59,475
and now we find you feasting and... and smoking!

78
00:10:59,653 --> 00:11:02,820
We are sitting on a field of victory...

79
00:11:02,989 --> 00:11:06,488
enjoying a few well-earned comforts.

80
00:11:07,576 --> 00:11:11,408
The salted pork is particularly good.

81
00:11:11,956 --> 00:11:14,328
Salted pork?

82
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:18,957
- Hobbits.
- We're under orders from Treebeard...

83
00:11:19,128 --> 00:11:21,963
who's taken over management of Isengard.

84
00:11:24,508 --> 00:11:27,509
Young Master Gandalf.

85
00:11:27,678 --> 00:11:32,257
I'm glad you've come.

86
00:11:32,433 --> 00:11:36,844
Wood and water, stock and stone I can master.

87
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:40,685
But there is a wizard to manage here...

88
00:11:40,856 --> 00:11:42,849
locked in his tower.

89
00:11:45,527 --> 00:11:46,856
Show yourself.

90
00:11:47,112 --> 00:11:48,819
Be careful.

91
00:11:49,613 --> 00:11:52,283
Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.

92
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,573
Well, let's just have his head and be done with it.

93
00:11:54,744 --> 00:11:56,783
No.

94
00:11:57,121 --> 00:11:59,446
We need him alive.

95
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,030
We need him to talk.

96
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,130
You have fought many wars and
slain many men, Theoden King...

97
00:12:09,298 --> 00:12:10,792
and made peace afterwards.

98
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:15,925
Can we not take counsel together
as we once did, my old friend?

99
00:12:16,096 --> 00:12:19,299
Can we not have peace, you and I?

100
00:12:19,474 --> 00:12:21,383
We shall have peace.

101
00:12:23,311 --> 00:12:25,434
We shall have peace...

102
00:12:25,605 --> 00:12:29,649
when you answer for the burning of the Westfold...

103
00:12:29,818 --> 00:12:32,568
and the children that lie dead there!

104
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,484
We shall have peace when the lives of the soldiers...

105
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:39,734
whose bodies were hewn even as they lay dead...

106
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:43,445
against the gates of the Hornburg, are avenged!

107
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:50,584
When you hang from a gibbet for
the sport of your own crows...

108
00:12:51,503 --> 00:12:53,745
we shall have peace.

109
00:12:56,508 --> 00:12:59,212
Gibbets and crows?

110
00:12:59,553 --> 00:13:00,797
Dotard!

111
00:13:02,262 --> 00:13:05,097
What do you want, Gandalf Greyhame?

112
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:08,591
Let me guess. The Key of Orthanc.

113
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:11,686
Or perhaps the Keys of Barad-dur itself...

114
00:13:11,855 --> 00:13:15,852
along with the crowns of the seven
kings and the rods of the Five Wizards!

115
00:13:16,026 --> 00:13:18,978
Your treachery has already cost many lives.

116
00:13:19,153 --> 00:13:21,525
Thousands more are now at risk.

117
00:13:21,697 --> 00:13:24,069
But you could save them, Saruman.

118
00:13:24,241 --> 00:13:26,529
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

119
00:13:26,702 --> 00:13:29,987
So you have come here for information.

120
00:13:30,872 --> 00:13:32,699
I have some for you.

121
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,124
Something festers in the heart of Middle-earth.

122
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:43,540
Something that you have failed to see.

123
00:13:46,053 --> 00:13:49,551
But the Great Eye has seen it.

124
00:13:50,598 --> 00:13:54,298
Even now he presses his advantage.

125
00:13:56,061 --> 00:13:59,395
His attack will come soon.

126
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,731
You're all going to die.

127
00:14:06,237 --> 00:14:09,487
But you know this, don't you, Gandalf?

128
00:14:09,657 --> 00:14:14,283
You cannot think that this Ranger will
ever sit upon the throne of Gondor.

129
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:20,538
This exile, crept from the
shadows, will never be crowned king.

130
00:14:21,877 --> 00:14:25,541
Gandalf does not hesitate to
sacrifice those closest to him...

131
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:28,670
those he professes to love.

132
00:14:29,717 --> 00:14:34,259
Tell me, what words of comfort
did you give the Halfling...

133
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:37,465
before you sent him to his doom?

134
00:14:39,892 --> 00:14:44,602
The path that you have set
him on can only lead to death.

135
00:14:44,939 --> 00:14:47,097
I've heard enough!

136
00:14:47,274 --> 00:14:49,100
Shoot him. Stick an arrow in his gob.

137
00:14:49,609 --> 00:14:51,269
No.

138
00:14:51,737 --> 00:14:53,943
Come down, Saruman...

139
00:14:54,114 --> 00:14:58,063
- and your life will be spared.
- Save your pity and your mercy.

140
00:14:58,243 --> 00:14:59,571
I have no use for it!

141
00:15:08,793 --> 00:15:10,252
Saruman...

142
00:15:11,296 --> 00:15:14,463
your staff is broken.

143
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,802
Grima, you need not follow him.

144
00:15:29,979 --> 00:15:32,648
You were not always as you are now.

145
00:15:32,815 --> 00:15:35,650
You were once a Man of Rohan.

146
00:15:35,818 --> 00:15:37,063
Come down.

147
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:39,941
A Man of Rohan?

148
00:15:40,865 --> 00:15:43,106
What is the house of Rohan...

149
00:15:43,283 --> 00:15:46,948
but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek...

150
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:50,820
and their brats roll on the floor with the dogs?

151
00:15:51,332 --> 00:15:57,785
The victory at Helm's Deep does not
belong to you, Theoden Horse-master.

152
00:15:58,422 --> 00:16:02,999
You are a lesser son of greater sires.

153
00:16:05,344 --> 00:16:07,052
Grima...

154
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:09,762
come down.

155
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:11,510
Be free of him.

156
00:16:11,685 --> 00:16:15,681
- Free? He will never be free.
- No.

157
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:18,684
Get down, cur!

158
00:16:20,441 --> 00:16:21,722
Saruman!

159
00:16:21,901 --> 00:16:24,522
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

160
00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:27,188
Tell us what you know!

161
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:33,941
You withdraw your guard, and I will
tell you where your doom will be decided.

162
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,655
I will not be held prisoner here.

163
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,316
Send word to all our allies...

164
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:09,401
and to every corner of
Middle-earth that still stands free.

165
00:17:09,944 --> 00:17:13,065
The enemy moves against us. We
need to know where he will strike.

166
00:17:32,256 --> 00:17:36,206
The filth of Saruman...

167
00:17:36,385 --> 00:17:40,216
is washing away.

168
00:17:40,389 --> 00:17:44,931
Trees will come back to live here.

169
00:17:45,434 --> 00:17:47,593
Young trees.

170
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,976
- Wild trees.
- Pippin!

171
00:17:59,447 --> 00:18:01,606
Bless my bark!

172
00:18:01,783 --> 00:18:03,656
Peregrin Took!

173
00:18:03,827 --> 00:18:06,448
I'll take that, my lad.

174
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,495
Quickly, now.

175
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:04,253
Tonight we remember those who gave
their blood to defend this country.

176
00:19:04,923 --> 00:19:06,963
Hail the victorious dead.

177
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:08,544
Hail!

178
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,429
No pauses.

179
00:19:21,605 --> 00:19:25,769
- No spills.
- And no regurgitation.

180
00:19:26,276 --> 00:19:27,935
So it's a drinking game?

181
00:19:29,487 --> 00:19:32,191
Last one standing wins.

182
00:19:36,535 --> 00:19:38,528
What'll we drink to? Let's drink to victory!

183
00:19:38,704 --> 00:19:40,115
To victory!

184
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,450
[Rohirric] <i>Westu Aragorn hál.</i>
[English] Be-thou Aragorn well!

185
00:20:24,078 --> 00:20:25,738
I am happy for you.

186
00:20:26,121 --> 00:20:28,529
He is an honorable man.

187
00:20:28,957 --> 00:20:31,412
You are both honorable men.

188
00:20:33,253 --> 00:20:38,591
It was not Theoden of Rohan
who led our people to victory.

189
00:20:46,765 --> 00:20:48,591
Don't listen to me.

190
00:20:49,434 --> 00:20:50,928
You are young.

191
00:20:51,102 --> 00:20:53,428
And tonight is for you.

192
00:21:07,784 --> 00:21:09,444
Here, here.

193
00:21:10,954 --> 00:21:16,872
It's the Dwarves that go
swimming with little, hairy women.

194
00:21:22,256 --> 00:21:23,500
I feel something.

195
00:21:25,634 --> 00:21:28,123
A slight tingle in my fingers.

196
00:21:28,844 --> 00:21:30,421
I think it's affecting me.

197
00:21:32,348 --> 00:21:34,055
What did I say?

198
00:21:34,224 --> 00:21:37,558
He can't hold his liquor.

199
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,229
Game over.

200
00:21:46,401 --> 00:21:49,818
Oh, you can search far and wide
You can drink the whole town dry

201
00:21:49,988 --> 00:21:53,938
But you'll never find a beer so brown
But you'll never find a beer so brown

202
00:21:54,118 --> 00:21:58,493
As the one we drink in our hometown
As the one we drink in our hometown

203
00:21:58,663 --> 00:22:02,577
You can drink your fancy ales
You can drink them by the flagon

204
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,916
But the only brew for the brave and true

205
00:22:08,548 --> 00:22:09,827
Pippin!

206
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:13,334
But the only brew for the brave and true

207
00:22:13,676 --> 00:22:16,381
Comes from The Green Dragon

208
00:22:19,099 --> 00:22:21,933
Thank you! I win!

209
00:22:23,686 --> 00:22:26,176
No news of Frodo?

210
00:22:26,354 --> 00:22:29,854
No word. Nothing.

211
00:22:30,692 --> 00:22:32,850
We have time.

212
00:22:34,362 --> 00:22:37,647
Every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor.

213
00:22:38,407 --> 00:22:40,483
Do we know that?

214
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:46,037
What does your heart tell you?

215
00:22:53,088 --> 00:22:56,420
That Frodo is alive.

216
00:22:58,592 --> 00:23:00,383
Yes.

217
00:23:02,971 --> 00:23:05,129
Yes, he's alive.

218
00:23:07,392 --> 00:23:10,226
Too risky. Too risky.

219
00:23:10,394 --> 00:23:11,639
Thieves.

220
00:23:11,812 --> 00:23:13,851
They stole it from us.

221
00:23:14,022 --> 00:23:17,522
Kill them. Kill them. Kill them both.

222
00:23:19,569 --> 00:23:22,404
Quiet! Mustn't wake them.

223
00:23:22,572 --> 00:23:25,109
Mustn't ruin it now.

224
00:23:25,282 --> 00:23:27,359
But they knows.

225
00:23:27,535 --> 00:23:29,408
They knows.

226
00:23:29,578 --> 00:23:32,199
They suspects us.

227
00:23:33,415 --> 00:23:36,949
What's it saying, my precious, my love?

228
00:23:37,127 --> 00:23:40,708
Is Smeagol losing his nerve?

229
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,752
No. Not.

230
00:23:43,925 --> 00:23:48,171
Never. Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses.

231
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:53,173
Smeagol wants to see them dead.

232
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,887
And we will.

233
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:00,105
Smeagol did it once. He can do it again.

234
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,112
It's ours!

235
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,948
Ours!

236
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:12,943
We must get the precious. We must get it back.

237
00:24:13,117 --> 00:24:16,533
Patience! Patience, my love.

238
00:24:16,704 --> 00:24:21,082
First we must lead them to her.

239
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:26,952
We lead them to the Winding Stair.

240
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:29,799
Yes, the stairs. And then?

241
00:24:29,966 --> 00:24:32,966
Up, up, up, up, up the stairs we go...

242
00:24:33,136 --> 00:24:39,552
until we come to the tunnel.

243
00:24:39,933 --> 00:24:43,053
And when they go in...

244
00:24:43,228 --> 00:24:46,015
there's no coming out.

245
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,811
She's always hungry.

246
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:54,778
She always needs to feed.

247
00:24:54,946 --> 00:24:56,357
She must eat.

248
00:24:56,532 --> 00:24:58,654
All she gets is filthy Orcses.

249
00:24:58,826 --> 00:25:01,577
And they doesn't taste very nice, does they, precious?

250
00:25:02,204 --> 00:25:03,828
No.

251
00:25:03,997 --> 00:25:08,705
Not very nice at all, my love.

252
00:25:08,876 --> 00:25:11,663
She hungers for sweeter meats.

253
00:25:11,837 --> 00:25:13,664
Hobbit meat.

254
00:25:13,838 --> 00:25:18,667
And when she throws away the
bones and the empty clothes...

255
00:25:18,844 --> 00:25:21,928
then we will find it.

256
00:25:22,097 --> 00:25:26,424
And take it for me!

257
00:25:28,185 --> 00:25:29,596
For us.

258
00:25:30,104 --> 00:25:33,105
Yes. We meant "for us."

259
00:25:33,273 --> 00:25:36,725
Gollum. Gollum.

260
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:41,397
The precious will be ours...

261
00:25:41,571 --> 00:25:46,068
once the Hobbitses are dead!

262
00:25:46,577 --> 00:25:48,036
You treacherous little toad!

263
00:25:50,747 --> 00:25:53,035
No! No! Master!

264
00:25:53,207 --> 00:25:54,832
No, Sam! Leave him alone!

265
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:58,379
I heard it from his own mouth. He means to murder us.

266
00:25:58,545 --> 00:26:02,709
Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly.

267
00:26:04,218 --> 00:26:06,791
He's a horrid, fat Hobbit...

268
00:26:06,971 --> 00:26:08,548
who hates Smeagol...

269
00:26:08,721 --> 00:26:11,509
and who makes up nasty lies.

270
00:26:11,683 --> 00:26:14,351
You miserable little maggot! I'll stove your head in!

271
00:26:14,727 --> 00:26:16,007
Sam!

272
00:26:16,395 --> 00:26:18,684
Call me a liar? You're a liar!

273
00:26:19,648 --> 00:26:23,561
- You scare him off, we're lost!
- I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.

274
00:26:23,735 --> 00:26:26,902
- I won't wait around for him to kill us!
- I'm not sending him away.

275
00:26:27,238 --> 00:26:28,567
You don't see it, do you?

276
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,400
He's a villain.

277
00:26:31,409 --> 00:26:35,027
We can't do this by ourselves,
Sam. Not without a guide.

278
00:26:35,872 --> 00:26:38,741
I need you on my side.

279
00:26:39,541 --> 00:26:41,866
I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.

280
00:26:43,378 --> 00:26:46,332
I know, Sam. I know.

281
00:26:46,881 --> 00:26:48,874
Trust me.

282
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:51,422
Come, Smeagol.

283
00:27:59,363 --> 00:28:00,822
What time is it?

284
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:04,653
Not yet dawn.

285
00:28:11,582 --> 00:28:14,618
I dreamed I saw a great wave...

286
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:18,792
climbing over green lands and above the hills.

287
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:22,503
I stood upon the brink.

288
00:28:23,426 --> 00:28:26,593
It was utterly dark in the abyss before my feet.

289
00:28:28,514 --> 00:28:31,301
A light shone behind me...

290
00:28:31,934 --> 00:28:34,342
but I could not turn.

291
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,935
I could only stand there, waiting.

292
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:42,103
Night changes many thoughts.

293
00:28:42,485 --> 00:28:44,644
Sleep, Eowyn.

294
00:28:45,196 --> 00:28:47,438
Sleep...

295
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,032
while you can.

296
00:29:16,182 --> 00:29:18,471
The stars are veiled.

297
00:29:19,478 --> 00:29:22,975
Something stirs in the east.

298
00:29:23,647 --> 00:29:26,766
A sleepless malice.

299
00:29:28,777 --> 00:29:31,564
The Eye of the enemy is moving.

300
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,705
What are you doing?

301
00:29:52,339 --> 00:29:53,798
Pippin!

302
00:30:01,307 --> 00:30:03,050
Pippin?

303
00:30:15,944 --> 00:30:17,273
Pippin.

304
00:30:17,947 --> 00:30:20,615
- What, are you mad?
- I just want to look at it.

305
00:30:20,782 --> 00:30:21,896
Just one more time.

306
00:30:22,158 --> 00:30:24,234
Put it back.

307
00:30:34,504 --> 00:30:36,294
Pippin.

308
00:30:42,802 --> 00:30:44,297
No!

309
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:50,636
Pippin.

310
00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:55,177
He is here.

311
00:30:55,355 --> 00:30:57,643
I see you.

312
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:02,276
Pippin!

313
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:19,667
Help! Gandalf, help!

314
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,293
Someone help him!

315
00:31:29,678 --> 00:31:30,876
Pippin!

316
00:31:32,014 --> 00:31:33,258
Fool of a Took!

317
00:31:54,366 --> 00:31:56,573
Look at me.

318
00:31:58,537 --> 00:32:02,665
Gandalf, forgive me.

319
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04,706
Look at me.

320
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:06,703
What did you see?

321
00:32:10,214 --> 00:32:12,290
A tree.

322
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:15,133
There was a white tree...

323
00:32:15,303 --> 00:32:16,797
in a courtyard of stone.

324
00:32:19,598 --> 00:32:20,877
It was dead.

325
00:32:25,061 --> 00:32:26,887
The city was burning.

326
00:32:27,062 --> 00:32:30,432
Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?

327
00:32:31,109 --> 00:32:33,147
I saw...

328
00:32:36,529 --> 00:32:37,905
I saw him.

329
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:43,151
I could hear his voice in my head.

330
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:45,735
And what did you tell him?

331
00:32:45,913 --> 00:32:47,740
Speak!

332
00:32:51,918 --> 00:32:55,084
He asked me my name. I didn't answer.

333
00:32:55,255 --> 00:32:56,714
He hurt me.

334
00:32:56,882 --> 00:32:59,337
What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?

335
00:33:02,846 --> 00:33:05,300
There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.

336
00:33:06,139 --> 00:33:08,381
A fool...

337
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:10,847
but an honest fool he remains.

338
00:33:11,311 --> 00:33:14,846
He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.

339
00:33:15,899 --> 00:33:18,270
We've been strangely fortunate.

340
00:33:18,442 --> 00:33:22,309
Pippin saw in the palantir a
glimpse of the enemy's plan.

341
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:27,188
Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith.

342
00:33:27,785 --> 00:33:31,533
His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing.

343
00:33:31,705 --> 00:33:34,029
He knows the heir of Elendil has come forth.

344
00:33:34,206 --> 00:33:36,329
Men are not as weak as he supposed.

345
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,284
There is courage still, strength
enough perhaps to challenge him.

346
00:33:40,504 --> 00:33:42,378
Sauron fears this.

347
00:33:42,547 --> 00:33:46,877
He will not risk the peoples of
Middle-earth uniting under one banner.

348
00:33:48,052 --> 00:33:50,460
He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground...

349
00:33:50,638 --> 00:33:54,137
before he sees a king return to the throne of Men.

350
00:33:54,308 --> 00:33:58,222
If the beacons of Gondor are
lit, Rohan must be ready for war.

351
00:33:59,146 --> 00:34:01,352
Tell me...

352
00:34:01,523 --> 00:34:05,306
why should we ride to the aid of
those who did not come to ours?

353
00:34:09,196 --> 00:34:11,023
What do we owe Gondor?

354
00:34:12,157 --> 00:34:14,197
- I will go.
- No!

355
00:34:14,368 --> 00:34:17,533
- They must be warned.
- They will be.

356
00:34:20,957 --> 00:34:23,495
You must come to Minas Tirith by another road.

357
00:34:24,043 --> 00:34:28,504
Follow the river. Look to the black ships.

358
00:34:29,465 --> 00:34:31,423
Understand this:

359
00:34:31,592 --> 00:34:35,256
Things are now in motion that cannot be undone.

360
00:34:36,763 --> 00:34:38,838
I ride for Minas Tirith...

361
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,770
and I won't be going alone.

362
00:34:45,521 --> 00:34:49,185
Of all the inquisitive Hobbits,
Peregrin Took, you are the worst.

363
00:34:50,191 --> 00:34:51,852
Hurry! Hurry!

364
00:34:53,362 --> 00:34:54,771
Where are we going?

365
00:34:54,946 --> 00:34:56,191
Why did you look?

366
00:34:56,365 --> 00:34:59,115
Why do you always have to look?

367
00:34:59,283 --> 00:35:02,366
- I don't know. I can't help it.
- You never can.

368
00:35:02,828 --> 00:35:04,238
I'm sorry, all right?

369
00:35:06,331 --> 00:35:09,249
- I won't do it again.
- Don't you understand?

370
00:35:10,002 --> 00:35:11,958
The enemy thinks you have the Ring.

371
00:35:12,128 --> 00:35:15,876
He's going to be looking for you,
Pip. They have to get you out of here.

372
00:35:17,299 --> 00:35:19,969
And you...? You're coming with me?

373
00:35:22,179 --> 00:35:23,589
Merry?

374
00:35:23,764 --> 00:35:25,044
Come on.

375
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:31,937
How far is Minas Tirith?

376
00:35:32,104 --> 00:35:34,725
Three days' ride, as the Nazgul flies.

377
00:35:34,898 --> 00:35:38,398
And you better hope we don't
have one of those on our tail.

378
00:35:39,111 --> 00:35:40,605
Here.

379
00:35:40,779 --> 00:35:42,571
Something for the road.

380
00:35:43,449 --> 00:35:45,405
The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

381
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:49,572
I know you've run out. You smoke too much, Pippin.

382
00:35:49,745 --> 00:35:52,236
But... But we'll see each other soon.

383
00:35:55,584 --> 00:35:58,075
- Won't we?
- I don't know.

384
00:36:00,089 --> 00:36:02,127
I don't know what's going to happen.

385
00:36:02,298 --> 00:36:04,006
- Merry.
- Run, Shadowfax.

386
00:36:04,175 --> 00:36:05,633
Show us the meaning of haste.

387
00:36:05,801 --> 00:36:07,711
Merry!

388
00:36:18,188 --> 00:36:19,302
Merry!

389
00:36:29,782 --> 00:36:31,275
He's always followed me...

390
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,989
everywhere I went...

391
00:36:34,327 --> 00:36:36,118
since before we were tweens.

392
00:36:37,288 --> 00:36:41,202
I would get him into the worst sort of trouble...

393
00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:43,451
but I was always there to get him out.

394
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,795
Now he's gone.

395
00:36:49,466 --> 00:36:52,383
Just like Frodo and Sam.

396
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:55,762
One thing I have learned about Hobbits:

397
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:57,591
They're a most hardy folk.

398
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,840
Foolhardy, maybe. He's a Took.

399
00:37:16,323 --> 00:37:18,611
Take her by the safest road.

400
00:37:18,784 --> 00:37:21,275
A ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens.

401
00:37:21,453 --> 00:37:25,320
It waits to carry her across the sea.

402
00:37:25,498 --> 00:37:28,868
The last journey of Arwen Undomiel.

403
00:38:34,477 --> 00:38:37,562
There is nothing for you here...

404
00:38:38,064 --> 00:38:40,270
only death.

405
00:38:47,572 --> 00:38:48,853
Lady Arwen...

406
00:38:49,783 --> 00:38:51,691
we cannot delay.

407
00:38:54,162 --> 00:38:55,406
My lady!

408
00:39:14,805 --> 00:39:17,426
- Tell me what you have seen.
- Arwen.

409
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,556
You have the gift of foresight.

410
00:39:19,726 --> 00:39:21,518
What did you see?

411
00:39:22,145 --> 00:39:25,479
I looked into your future, and I saw death.

412
00:39:26,024 --> 00:39:28,146
But there is also life.

413
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:34,113
You saw there was a child. You saw my son.

414
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,277
That future is almost gone.

415
00:39:37,451 --> 00:39:39,443
But it is not lost.

416
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:44,244
Nothing is certain.

417
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:48,663
Some things are certain.

418
00:39:52,465 --> 00:39:55,299
If I leave him now...

419
00:39:55,467 --> 00:39:58,087
I will regret it forever.

420
00:39:59,178 --> 00:40:01,503
It is time.

421
00:40:06,768 --> 00:40:10,552
From the ashes a fire shall be woken

422
00:40:10,731 --> 00:40:14,146
A light from the shadow shall spring

423
00:40:14,316 --> 00:40:17,602
Renewed shall be blade that was broken

424
00:40:24,993 --> 00:40:28,196
The crownless again shall be king

425
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:33,997
Re-forge the sword.

426
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,700
[Sindarin] <i>Ada.</i>
[English] Father.

427
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:11,571
Your hands are cold.

428
00:41:14,954 --> 00:41:18,075
The life of the Eldar is leaving you.

429
00:41:21,503 --> 00:41:23,412
This was my choice.

430
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
[Sindarin] <i>Ada...</i>
[English] Father...

431
00:41:25,256 --> 00:41:27,544
Whether by your will or not...

432
00:41:28,884 --> 00:41:33,178
there is no ship now that can bear me hence.

433
00:42:20,389 --> 00:42:23,225
We've just passed into the realm of Gondor.

434
00:42:34,861 --> 00:42:37,102
Minas Tirith.

435
00:42:37,697 --> 00:42:40,022
City of kings.

436
00:43:11,393 --> 00:43:13,185
Make way!

437
00:43:42,379 --> 00:43:44,207
It's the tree.

438
00:43:44,381 --> 00:43:46,041
Gandalf. Gandalf.

439
00:43:46,216 --> 00:43:48,458
Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.

440
00:43:48,635 --> 00:43:50,462
The tree of the king.

441
00:43:50,637 --> 00:43:53,307
Lord Denethor, however, is not king.

442
00:43:53,474 --> 00:43:56,141
He is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne.

443
00:43:56,892 --> 00:44:00,427
Now listen carefully. Lord
Denethor is Boromir's father.

444
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:04,764
To give him news of his beloved
son's death would be most unwise.

445
00:44:05,233 --> 00:44:08,685
And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.

446
00:44:09,571 --> 00:44:12,322
And say nothing of Aragorn either.

447
00:44:14,158 --> 00:44:18,025
In fact, it's better if you
don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.

448
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:54,689
Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion,
lord and steward of Gondor.

449
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:04,908
I come with tidings in this
dark hour, and with counsel.

450
00:45:05,871 --> 00:45:09,240
Perhaps you come to explain this.

451
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:19,422
Perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead.

452
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,897
Boromir died to save us...

453
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,727
my kinsman and me.

454
00:45:38,901 --> 00:45:42,400
- He fell defending us from many foes.
- Pippin.

455
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:51,360
I offer you my service, such as it is...

456
00:45:51,913 --> 00:45:53,905
in payment of this debt.

457
00:45:56,083 --> 00:45:59,416
This is my first command to you.

458
00:46:00,129 --> 00:46:03,580
How did you escape and my son did not...

459
00:46:03,923 --> 00:46:06,249
so mighty a man as he was?

460
00:46:06,927 --> 00:46:10,259
The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow...

461
00:46:10,513 --> 00:46:12,422
and Boromir was pierced by many.

462
00:46:16,561 --> 00:46:18,268
Get up.

463
00:46:18,437 --> 00:46:23,063
My lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir...

464
00:46:23,524 --> 00:46:25,267
but it is not now.

465
00:46:25,985 --> 00:46:28,191
War is coming.

466
00:46:28,529 --> 00:46:32,941
The enemy is on your doorstep.
As steward, you are charged...

467
00:46:33,117 --> 00:46:37,280
with the defense of this city.
Where are Gondor's armies?

468
00:46:37,454 --> 00:46:42,329
You still have friends. You
are not alone in this fight.

469
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:46,996
Send word to Theoden of Rohan. Light the beacons.

470
00:46:48,589 --> 00:46:52,124
You think you are wise, Mithrandir.

471
00:46:52,301 --> 00:46:55,337
Yet for all your subtleties, you have not wisdom.

472
00:46:57,472 --> 00:47:01,635
Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind?

473
00:47:01,809 --> 00:47:04,894
I have seen more than you know.

474
00:47:05,063 --> 00:47:08,265
With your left hand you would
use me as a shield against Mordor.

475
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,310
And with your right you'd seek to supplant me.

476
00:47:11,484 --> 00:47:15,185
I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan.

477
00:47:15,363 --> 00:47:21,318
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears
of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

478
00:47:21,494 --> 00:47:26,321
And I tell you now, I will not bow
to this Ranger from the North...

479
00:47:26,498 --> 00:47:30,994
last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship.

480
00:47:31,169 --> 00:47:37,005
Authority is not given to you to
deny the return of the king, steward.

481
00:47:37,175 --> 00:47:41,587
The rule of Gondor is mine and no other's.

482
00:47:46,767 --> 00:47:48,558
Come.

483
00:47:56,484 --> 00:47:59,057
All has turned to vain ambition.

484
00:47:59,236 --> 00:48:02,687
He would even use his grief as a cloak.

485
00:48:05,576 --> 00:48:08,361
A thousand years this city has stood.

486
00:48:09,454 --> 00:48:11,861
Now, at the whim of a madman, it will fall.

487
00:48:13,082 --> 00:48:15,288
And the White Tree, the tree of the king...

488
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:17,002
will never bloom again.

489
00:48:17,169 --> 00:48:20,538
- Why are they still guarding it?
- They guard it because they have hope.

490
00:48:20,715 --> 00:48:23,880
A faint and fading hope that one day it will flower.

491
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:28,795
That a king will come and this
city will be as it once was...

492
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:31,888
before it fell into decay.

493
00:48:32,058 --> 00:48:35,308
The old wisdom borne out of the West was forsaken.

494
00:48:35,477 --> 00:48:39,770
Kings made tombs more splendid
than the houses of the living...

495
00:48:39,981 --> 00:48:41,890
and counted the old names of their descent...

496
00:48:42,066 --> 00:48:44,853
dearer than the names of their sons.

497
00:48:45,028 --> 00:48:50,068
Childless lords sat in aged
halls, musing on heraldry...

498
00:48:50,241 --> 00:48:55,579
or in high, cold towers, asking questions of the stars.

499
00:48:55,745 --> 00:48:59,529
And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin.

500
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,825
The line of kings failed.

501
00:49:03,544 --> 00:49:05,916
The White Tree withered.

502
00:49:06,629 --> 00:49:10,793
The rule of Gondor was given over to lesser men.

503
00:49:21,518 --> 00:49:22,763
Mordor.

504
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:26,935
Yes, there it lies.

505
00:49:27,774 --> 00:49:31,108
This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow.

506
00:49:33,112 --> 00:49:34,772
A storm is coming.

507
00:49:35,448 --> 00:49:38,365
This is not the weather of the world.

508
00:49:38,533 --> 00:49:40,740
This is a device of Sauron's making.

509
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:44,659
A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host.

510
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:47,703
The Orcs of Mordor have no love of daylight...

511
00:49:47,876 --> 00:49:49,703
so he covers the face of the sun...

512
00:49:49,878 --> 00:49:53,625
to ease their passage along the road to war.

513
00:49:53,798 --> 00:49:57,083
When the Shadow of Mordor reaches this city...

514
00:49:57,801 --> 00:49:59,509
it will begin.

515
00:50:01,179 --> 00:50:02,757
Well...

516
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:04,468
Minas Tirith...

517
00:50:06,392 --> 00:50:07,803
very impressive.

518
00:50:07,976 --> 00:50:10,598
- So where are we off to next?
- Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin.

519
00:50:10,771 --> 00:50:12,978
There's no leaving this city.

520
00:50:15,317 --> 00:50:18,520
Help must come to us.

521
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:22,699
It must be getting near teatime.

522
00:50:22,865 --> 00:50:26,566
Leastways, it would be in decent
places where there is still teatime.

523
00:50:26,744 --> 00:50:30,327
We're not in decent places.

524
00:50:35,877 --> 00:50:37,122
Mr. Frodo?

525
00:50:40,173 --> 00:50:41,370
What is it?

526
00:50:43,843 --> 00:50:46,215
It's just a feeling.

527
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:50,797
I don't think I'll be coming back.

528
00:50:55,312 --> 00:50:57,849
Yes, you will. Of course you will.

529
00:50:58,481 --> 00:51:00,354
That's just morbid thinking.

530
00:51:00,817 --> 00:51:03,272
We're going there and back again...

531
00:51:03,444 --> 00:51:05,732
just like Mr. Bilbo.

532
00:51:06,697 --> 00:51:08,820
You'll see.

533
00:51:16,998 --> 00:51:20,615
I think these lands were once
part of the kingdom of Gondor.

534
00:51:25,005 --> 00:51:29,049
Long ago, when there was a king.

535
00:51:49,694 --> 00:51:52,528
Mr. Frodo, look.

536
00:51:54,155 --> 00:51:56,907
The king has got a crown again.

537
00:52:08,044 --> 00:52:12,290
Come on, Hobbits! Mustn't stop now. This way.

538
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:33,191
So I imagine this is just a ceremonial position.

539
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:37,605
I mean, they don't actually
expect me to do any fighting.

540
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:41,696
- Do they?
- You're in the service of the steward now.

541
00:52:41,865 --> 00:52:45,235
You'll have to do as you're told, Peregrin Took.

542
00:52:49,288 --> 00:52:51,780
Ridiculous Hobbit.

543
00:52:52,959 --> 00:52:55,165
Guard of the Citadel.

544
00:53:04,678 --> 00:53:06,504
Thank you.

545
00:53:15,896 --> 00:53:18,138
There's no more stars.

546
00:53:18,648 --> 00:53:19,847
Is it time?

547
00:53:21,026 --> 00:53:22,769
Yes.

548
00:53:25,405 --> 00:53:27,065
It's so quiet.

549
00:53:28,074 --> 00:53:32,321
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

550
00:53:33,496 --> 00:53:36,365
I don't want to be in a battle...

551
00:53:37,208 --> 00:53:42,165
but waiting on the edge of one
I can't escape is even worse.

552
00:53:45,716 --> 00:53:49,333
Is there any hope, Gandalf, for Frodo and Sam?

553
00:53:50,677 --> 00:53:53,797
There never was much hope.

554
00:53:55,766 --> 00:53:57,509
Just a fool's hope.

555
00:54:03,397 --> 00:54:06,184
Our enemy is ready.

556
00:54:06,358 --> 00:54:09,028
His full strength's gathered.

557
00:54:09,195 --> 00:54:12,693
Not only Orcs, but Men as well.

558
00:54:12,865 --> 00:54:15,901
Legions of Haradrim from the south...

559
00:54:16,076 --> 00:54:18,779
mercenaries from the coast.

560
00:54:18,953 --> 00:54:21,526
All will answer Mordor's call.

561
00:54:21,705 --> 00:54:23,247
Come on.

562
00:54:24,375 --> 00:54:27,708
This will be the end of Gondor as we know it.

563
00:54:27,878 --> 00:54:31,247
Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.

564
00:54:32,216 --> 00:54:36,544
If the river is taken, if the
garrison at Osgiliath falls...

565
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:40,384
the last defense of this city will be gone.

566
00:54:40,556 --> 00:54:44,601
But we have the White Wizard.
That's got to count for something.

567
00:54:50,481 --> 00:54:52,059
Gandalf?

568
00:54:55,778 --> 00:54:59,443
Sauron has yet to reveal his deadliest servant...

569
00:54:59,907 --> 00:55:03,738
the one who will lead Mordor's armies in war.

570
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:09,070
The one they say no living man can kill.

571
00:55:10,083 --> 00:55:12,241
The Witch King of Angmar.

572
00:55:13,335 --> 00:55:15,708
You've met him before.

573
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:18,953
He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

574
00:55:25,514 --> 00:55:28,218
He is the lord of the Nazgul...

575
00:55:28,683 --> 00:55:31,139
the greatest of the Nine.

576
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:34,928
Minas Morgul is his lair.

577
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,934
The Dead City.

578
00:55:42,111 --> 00:55:47,318
Very nasty place. Full of enemies.

579
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:56,698
Quick. Quick.

580
00:55:56,875 --> 00:56:00,872
They will see. They will see.

581
00:56:10,136 --> 00:56:15,427
Come away. Come away. Look, we have found it.

582
00:56:15,601 --> 00:56:19,467
The way into Mordor.

583
00:56:19,645 --> 00:56:23,975
The secret stair.

584
00:56:24,399 --> 00:56:26,771
Climb.

585
00:56:47,044 --> 00:56:49,796
- No, Mr. Frodo!
- Not that way!

586
00:56:54,635 --> 00:56:57,506
- What's it doing?
- No.

587
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,763
- They're calling me.
- No.

588
00:57:30,417 --> 00:57:33,371
Hide! Hide!

589
00:58:16,918 --> 00:58:19,753
I can feel his blade.

590
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:33,554
We come to it at last.

591
00:58:35,392 --> 00:58:38,263
The great battle of our time.

592
00:59:17,431 --> 00:59:20,680
Come away, Hobbits. We climb. We must climb.

593
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,568
The board is set.

594
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:36,275
The pieces are moving.

595
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:41,495
Up, up, up the stairs we go.

596
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:44,329
And then it's into the tunnel.

597
00:59:44,496 --> 00:59:47,700
Hey, what's in this tunnel?

598
00:59:48,249 --> 00:59:51,001
You listen to me, and you listen good and proper.

599
00:59:51,169 --> 00:59:54,087
Anything happens to him, you have me to answer to.

600
00:59:54,255 --> 00:59:55,833
One sniff something's not right...

601
00:59:56,008 --> 00:59:59,173
one hair stands up on the back of my head, it's over.

602
00:59:59,384 --> 01:00:02,054
No more slinker. No more stinker.

603
01:00:02,387 --> 01:00:05,009
You're gone. Got it?

604
01:00:05,891 --> 01:00:07,883
I'm watching you.

605
01:00:13,231 --> 01:00:15,223
What was that about?

606
01:00:15,399 --> 01:00:17,806
Nothing. Just clearing something up.

607
01:00:24,449 --> 01:00:27,320
Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task now to be done.

608
01:00:27,494 --> 01:00:32,071
Another opportunity for one of the
Shire-folk to prove their great worth.

609
01:00:36,919 --> 01:00:38,497
You must not fail me.

610
01:01:12,742 --> 01:01:15,826
It's been very quiet across the river.

611
01:01:15,995 --> 01:01:18,320
The Orcs are lying low.

612
01:01:18,498 --> 01:01:20,490
The garrison may have moved out.

613
01:01:21,626 --> 01:01:24,330
We've sent scouts to Cair Andros.

614
01:01:24,504 --> 01:01:27,788
If the Orcs attack from the
north, we'll have some warning.

615
01:01:53,112 --> 01:01:54,311
Quiet.

616
01:01:58,408 --> 01:02:00,366
We need 10 more.

617
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,222
Kill him!

618
01:02:40,531 --> 01:02:42,937
They're not coming from the north.

619
01:02:44,367 --> 01:02:48,696
To the river. Quick. Quick. Go. Come on.

620
01:02:52,166 --> 01:02:53,743
Faster.

621
01:03:06,888 --> 01:03:09,260
Draw swords.

622
01:04:03,814 --> 01:04:06,387
Hold! Hold them!

623
01:05:26,679 --> 01:05:28,554
What?

624
01:05:41,109 --> 01:05:42,520
Amon Din

625
01:05:48,325 --> 01:05:51,361
The beacon. The beacon of Amon Din is lit.

626
01:05:54,621 --> 01:05:58,833
Hope is kindled.

627
01:07:31,209 --> 01:07:35,587
The beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons are lit!

628
01:07:36,798 --> 01:07:38,421
Gondor calls for aid.

629
01:07:48,933 --> 01:07:51,851
And Rohan will answer.

630
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:55,056
Muster the Rohirrim.

631
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,118
Assemble the army at Dunharrow.

632
01:08:12,287 --> 01:08:16,665
As many men as can be found. You have two days.

633
01:08:16,833 --> 01:08:22,124
On the third, we ride for Gondor and war.

634
01:08:23,088 --> 01:08:24,417
- Forward.
- Very good, sir.

635
01:08:24,590 --> 01:08:25,918
- Gamling.
- My lord.

636
01:08:26,091 --> 01:08:27,669
Make haste across the Riddermark.

637
01:08:27,844 --> 01:08:29,966
Summon every able-bodied man to Dunharrow.

638
01:08:30,137 --> 01:08:31,715
I will.

639
01:08:35,809 --> 01:08:38,975
- Will you ride with us?
- Just to the encampment.

640
01:08:39,144 --> 01:08:43,059
It's tradition for the women of
the court to farewell the men.

641
01:08:49,613 --> 01:08:51,523
The men have found their captain.

642
01:08:51,699 --> 01:08:55,031
They will follow you into battle, even to death.

643
01:08:55,201 --> 01:08:56,779
You have given us hope.

644
01:08:59,997 --> 01:09:01,955
Excuse me.

645
01:09:03,292 --> 01:09:04,786
I have a sword.

646
01:09:05,086 --> 01:09:06,461
Please accept it.

647
01:09:07,587 --> 01:09:12,083
I offer you my service, Theoden King.

648
01:09:15,511 --> 01:09:17,587
And gladly I accept it.

649
01:09:18,681 --> 01:09:22,760
You shall be Meriadoc, esquire of Rohan.

650
01:09:27,647 --> 01:09:28,845
Horse-Men.

651
01:09:29,524 --> 01:09:35,147
I wish I could muster a legion of
Dwarves, fully armed and filthy.

652
01:09:35,530 --> 01:09:38,483
Your kinsmen may have no need to ride to war.

653
01:09:38,657 --> 01:09:42,073
I fear war already marches on their own lands.

654
01:10:00,552 --> 01:10:04,003
So it is before the walls of Minas Tirith...

655
01:10:04,181 --> 01:10:08,047
the doom of our time will be decided.

656
01:10:10,644 --> 01:10:16,184
Now is the hour. Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.

657
01:10:16,358 --> 01:10:19,892
Now, fulfill them all. To lord and land!

658
01:11:02,983 --> 01:11:04,941
Faramir!

659
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:14,941
We can't hold them. The city is lost.

660
01:11:15,536 --> 01:11:18,620
Tell the men to break cover. We ride for Minas Tirith.

661
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:29,622
Nazgul.

662
01:11:32,010 --> 01:11:34,465
Take cover!

663
01:11:34,637 --> 01:11:37,174
Nazgul!

664
01:11:37,347 --> 01:11:41,012
Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!

665
01:11:47,607 --> 01:11:49,481
Fall back!

666
01:11:56,531 --> 01:12:01,110
- Retreat! Retreat!
- Run for your lives!

667
01:12:25,349 --> 01:12:29,678
The age of Men is over.

668
01:12:29,853 --> 01:12:35,475
The time of the Orc has come.

669
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:40,185
- Keep going.
- It's the Nazgul.

670
01:12:41,822 --> 01:12:44,194
Take cover, my lord!

671
01:12:44,491 --> 01:12:45,820
It's coming!

672
01:12:51,372 --> 01:12:54,741
- It's Mithrandir.
- The White Rider!

673
01:13:34,703 --> 01:13:36,078
Pull!

674
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:56,211
Mithrandir.

675
01:13:56,389 --> 01:13:58,133
They broke through our defenses.

676
01:13:58,308 --> 01:14:00,514
They've taken the bridge and the west bank.

677
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:05,765
- Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.
- It is as the Lord Denethor predicted.

678
01:14:05,939 --> 01:14:10,482
- Long has he foreseen this doom.
- Foreseen and done nothing.

679
01:14:13,863 --> 01:14:16,272
Faramir?

680
01:14:18,201 --> 01:14:22,032
This is not the first Halfling
to have crossed your path.

681
01:14:22,204 --> 01:14:24,410
No.

682
01:14:25,749 --> 01:14:27,291
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

683
01:14:28,168 --> 01:14:31,584
- Where? When?
- In Ithilien.

684
01:14:31,755 --> 01:14:33,830
Not two days ago.

685
01:14:34,298 --> 01:14:38,758
Gandalf, they're taking the road to the Morgul Vale.

686
01:14:39,470 --> 01:14:42,091
And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.

687
01:14:44,308 --> 01:14:46,680
What does that mean?

688
01:14:46,852 --> 01:14:51,761
- What's wrong?
- Faramir, tell me everything.

689
01:14:51,939 --> 01:14:53,978
Tell me all you know.

690
01:14:55,151 --> 01:14:58,566
This is how you would serve your city?

691
01:14:58,738 --> 01:15:02,023
You would risk its utter ruin?

692
01:15:03,074 --> 01:15:04,651
I did what I judged to be right.

693
01:15:05,367 --> 01:15:08,368
What you judged to be right.

694
01:15:08,996 --> 01:15:14,869
You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor
in the hands of a witless Halfling.

695
01:15:18,838 --> 01:15:23,666
It should have been brought back
to the Citadel to be kept safe.

696
01:15:25,303 --> 01:15:26,845
Hidden.

697
01:15:27,263 --> 01:15:30,015
Dark and deep in the vaults...

698
01:15:30,182 --> 01:15:32,341
not to be used.

699
01:15:36,521 --> 01:15:41,397
Unless at the uttermost end of need.

700
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:43,899
I would not use the Ring.

701
01:15:44,070 --> 01:15:47,155
Not if Minas Tirith were falling
in ruin and I alone could save her.

702
01:15:47,489 --> 01:15:52,316
Ever you desire to appear lordly and gracious...

703
01:15:52,494 --> 01:15:54,736
as a king of old.

704
01:15:56,539 --> 01:16:00,288
Boromir would have remembered his father's need.

705
01:16:00,710 --> 01:16:03,165
He would have brought me a kingly gift.

706
01:16:03,378 --> 01:16:05,916
Boromir would not have brought the Ring.

707
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:09,459
He would have stretched out his hand to
this thing and taken it. He would've fallen.

708
01:16:09,634 --> 01:16:11,876
- You know nothing of this matter!
- He would have kept it for his own.

709
01:16:13,764 --> 01:16:15,922
And when he returned...

710
01:16:17,057 --> 01:16:18,717
you would not have known your son.

711
01:16:18,892 --> 01:16:21,430
Boromir was loyal to me!

712
01:16:21,603 --> 01:16:24,176
Not some wizard's pupil!

713
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:33,649
Father?

714
01:16:46,335 --> 01:16:48,243
My son.

715
01:17:14,485 --> 01:17:15,860
Leave me.

716
01:17:49,432 --> 01:17:51,970
Careful, master. Careful.

717
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:55,228
Very far to fall.

718
01:17:57,732 --> 01:18:01,645
Very dangerous are the stairs.

719
01:18:04,321 --> 01:18:06,859
Come, master.

720
01:18:12,663 --> 01:18:15,828
Come to Smeagol.

721
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:23,664
Mr. Frodo.

722
01:18:24,673 --> 01:18:26,215
Get back, you!

723
01:18:26,383 --> 01:18:28,589
Don't touch him!

724
01:18:32,721 --> 01:18:35,556
Why does he hates poor Smeagol?

725
01:18:35,724 --> 01:18:39,425
What has Smeagol ever done to him?

726
01:18:39,603 --> 01:18:41,975
Master?

727
01:18:42,772 --> 01:18:46,223
Master carries heavy burden.

728
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:51,821
Smeagol knows. Heavy, heavy burden.

729
01:18:51,989 --> 01:18:55,239
Fat one cannot know.

730
01:18:57,286 --> 01:19:00,036
Smeagol look after master.

731
01:19:01,247 --> 01:19:03,454
He wants it.

732
01:19:03,624 --> 01:19:08,167
He needs it. Smeagol sees it in his eye.

733
01:19:08,337 --> 01:19:13,793
Very soon he will ask you for it. You will see.

734
01:19:13,968 --> 01:19:17,834
The fat one will take it from you.

735
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:29,390
Send forth all legions.

736
01:19:29,564 --> 01:19:33,609
Do not stop the attack until the city is taken.

737
01:19:34,319 --> 01:19:37,439
Slay them all.

738
01:19:39,115 --> 01:19:44,903
- What of the wizard?
- I will break him.

739
01:19:48,248 --> 01:19:50,655
Where are Theoden's riders?

740
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:53,407
Will Rohan's army come?

741
01:19:53,586 --> 01:19:55,828
Mithrandir.

742
01:19:56,881 --> 01:20:00,747
Courage is the best defense that you have now.

743
01:20:05,556 --> 01:20:08,260
What were you thinking, Peregrin Took?

744
01:20:10,351 --> 01:20:16,056
What service can a Hobbit
offer such a great lord of Men?

745
01:20:16,231 --> 01:20:17,726
It was well-done.

746
01:20:20,902 --> 01:20:24,947
A generous deed should not
be checked with cold counsel.

747
01:20:25,698 --> 01:20:28,237
You are to join the tower guard.

748
01:20:28,785 --> 01:20:31,784
I didn't think they would find
any livery that would fit me.

749
01:20:31,954 --> 01:20:34,409
Once belonged to a young boy of the city.

750
01:20:34,581 --> 01:20:36,123
A very foolish one...

751
01:20:36,291 --> 01:20:40,538
who wasted many hours slaying dragons
instead of attending to his studies.

752
01:20:40,712 --> 01:20:43,464
- This was yours?
- Yes, it was mine.

753
01:20:43,632 --> 01:20:45,422
My father had it made for me.

754
01:20:46,467 --> 01:20:47,796
Well...

755
01:20:47,969 --> 01:20:49,960
I'm taller than you were then.

756
01:20:50,137 --> 01:20:53,471
Though I'm not likely to grow anymore, except sideways.

757
01:20:56,435 --> 01:20:58,474
Never fitted me either.

758
01:20:58,644 --> 01:21:01,480
Boromir was always the soldier.

759
01:21:04,484 --> 01:21:06,891
They were so alike, he and my father.

760
01:21:08,988 --> 01:21:10,613
Proud.

761
01:21:10,781 --> 01:21:11,979
Stubborn even.

762
01:21:13,742 --> 01:21:15,236
But strong.

763
01:21:16,744 --> 01:21:19,911
I think you have strength of a different kind.

764
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:22,995
And one day your father will see it.

765
01:21:27,171 --> 01:21:30,954
Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor...

766
01:21:31,132 --> 01:21:32,627
in peace or war...

767
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:35,715
in living or dying...

768
01:21:37,097 --> 01:21:38,341
from...

769
01:21:41,017 --> 01:21:43,803
From this hour henceforth...

770
01:21:43,977 --> 01:21:45,886
until my lord release me...

771
01:21:47,397 --> 01:21:49,603
or death take me.

772
01:21:50,191 --> 01:21:52,682
And I shall not forget it...

773
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:56,230
nor fail to reward that which is given.

774
01:22:03,829 --> 01:22:06,117
Fealty with love.

775
01:22:07,206 --> 01:22:08,867
Valor with honor.

776
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:13,792
Disloyalty with vengeance.

777
01:22:22,429 --> 01:22:26,509
I do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses...

778
01:22:26,683 --> 01:22:29,434
defenses that your brother long held intact.

779
01:22:29,601 --> 01:22:32,092
- What would you have me do?
- I will not yield...

780
01:22:32,271 --> 01:22:35,058
the river in Pelennor unfought.

781
01:22:35,232 --> 01:22:36,892
Osgiliath must be retaken.

782
01:22:37,067 --> 01:22:39,107
My lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

783
01:22:39,778 --> 01:22:42,564
Much must be risked in war.

784
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:49,149
Is there a captain here who still
has the courage to do his lord's will?

785
01:22:55,375 --> 01:22:58,624
You wish now that our places had been exchanged...

786
01:22:59,587 --> 01:23:02,422
that I had died and Boromir had lived.

787
01:23:05,843 --> 01:23:07,586
Yes.

788
01:23:08,262 --> 01:23:10,468
I wish that.

789
01:23:18,854 --> 01:23:21,345
Since you were robbed of Boromir...

790
01:23:23,192 --> 01:23:26,110
I will do what I can in his stead.

791
01:23:34,285 --> 01:23:38,745
If I should return, think better of me, Father.

792
01:23:40,833 --> 01:23:44,450
That will depend on the manner of your return.

793
01:25:07,745 --> 01:25:10,070
What are you up to?

794
01:25:10,247 --> 01:25:11,491
Sneaking off, are we?

795
01:25:12,207 --> 01:25:14,033
Sneaking?

796
01:25:15,042 --> 01:25:17,200
Sneaking?

797
01:25:18,629 --> 01:25:21,795
Fat Hobbit is always so polite.

798
01:25:21,966 --> 01:25:27,041
Smeagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find...

799
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:29,378
and they say "sneak."

800
01:25:30,014 --> 01:25:32,588
Sneak?

801
01:25:33,225 --> 01:25:35,930
Very nice friend. Oh, yes, my precious.

802
01:25:36,103 --> 01:25:38,725
- Very nice, very nice.
- All right. All right!

803
01:25:39,982 --> 01:25:42,187
You just startled me is all.

804
01:25:42,692 --> 01:25:44,519
What were you doing?

805
01:25:46,154 --> 01:25:48,276
Sneaking.

806
01:25:48,656 --> 01:25:51,741
Fine. Have it your own way.

807
01:25:53,995 --> 01:25:56,485
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.

808
01:25:56,872 --> 01:25:58,828
We have to be moving on.

809
01:26:04,003 --> 01:26:05,581
It's dark still.

810
01:26:05,755 --> 01:26:07,961
It's always dark here.

811
01:26:12,219 --> 01:26:14,127
It's gone!

812
01:26:15,347 --> 01:26:18,217
- The Elven bread.
- What?

813
01:26:18,391 --> 01:26:19,850
That's all we have left.

814
01:26:23,938 --> 01:26:26,429
He took it. He must have!

815
01:26:26,940 --> 01:26:30,191
Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol.

816
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:33,278
Smeagol hates nasty Elf bread.

817
01:26:33,447 --> 01:26:36,613
You're a lying rat! What did you do with it?!

818
01:26:36,783 --> 01:26:38,325
He doesn't eat it.

819
01:26:39,328 --> 01:26:41,652
- He can't have taken it.
- Look.

820
01:26:42,704 --> 01:26:44,532
What's this?

821
01:26:47,209 --> 01:26:50,543
Crumbs on his jacketses. He took it!

822
01:26:51,254 --> 01:26:52,915
He took it.

823
01:26:53,757 --> 01:26:57,967
I seen him. He's always stuffing
his face when master's not looking.

824
01:26:58,136 --> 01:26:59,927
That's a filthy lie!

825
01:27:00,095 --> 01:27:02,302
You stinking, two-faced sneak!

826
01:27:02,472 --> 01:27:03,718
- Sam!
- Call me...

827
01:27:03,891 --> 01:27:05,136
Stop it!

828
01:27:06,143 --> 01:27:07,341
Sam!

829
01:27:08,645 --> 01:27:12,262
- I'll kill him!
- Sam! No!

830
01:27:13,316 --> 01:27:18,855
Oh, my... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to go so far. I was just so... So angry.

831
01:27:19,029 --> 01:27:21,152
Here, just... Let's
just rest a bit.

832
01:27:21,323 --> 01:27:23,399
- I'm all right.
- No.

833
01:27:23,575 --> 01:27:26,659
No, you're not all right. You're exhausted.

834
01:27:26,827 --> 01:27:28,950
It's that Gollum.

835
01:27:29,121 --> 01:27:30,830
It's this place.

836
01:27:30,998 --> 01:27:33,571
It's that thing around your neck.

837
01:27:37,088 --> 01:27:38,368
I could help a bit.

838
01:27:38,547 --> 01:27:41,215
I could carry it for a while.

839
01:27:41,383 --> 01:27:43,126
Carry it for a while.

840
01:27:43,301 --> 01:27:44,546
I could carry it... I could carry it.

841
01:27:45,178 --> 01:27:50,634
Share the load... Share the
load... the load... the load.

842
01:27:50,808 --> 01:27:52,007
Get away!

843
01:27:52,185 --> 01:27:53,761
I don't want to keep it.

844
01:27:57,356 --> 01:27:59,347
I just want to help.

845
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:04,023
See? See?

846
01:28:04,195 --> 01:28:07,611
He wants it for himself.

847
01:28:07,783 --> 01:28:09,489
Shut up, you!

848
01:28:10,033 --> 01:28:11,860
Go away! Get out of here!

849
01:28:12,035 --> 01:28:13,862
No, Sam.

850
01:28:14,037 --> 01:28:15,282
It's you.

851
01:28:19,501 --> 01:28:21,208
I'm sorry, Sam.

852
01:28:22,879 --> 01:28:24,253
But he's a liar.

853
01:28:24,421 --> 01:28:27,090
He's poisoned you against me.

854
01:28:28,509 --> 01:28:30,417
You can't help me anymore.

855
01:28:32,387 --> 01:28:34,260
You don't mean that.

856
01:28:36,767 --> 01:28:38,557
Go home.

857
01:29:58,590 --> 01:30:00,381
Faramir!

858
01:30:00,550 --> 01:30:02,459
Faramir!

859
01:30:03,970 --> 01:30:06,010
Your father's will has turned to madness.

860
01:30:07,180 --> 01:30:09,220
Do not throw away your life so rashly.

861
01:30:09,975 --> 01:30:12,300
Where does my allegiance lie if not here?

862
01:30:12,936 --> 01:30:15,854
This is the city of the Men of Numenor.

863
01:30:16,481 --> 01:30:19,268
I will gladly give my life to defend her beauty...

864
01:30:19,442 --> 01:30:22,645
her memory, her wisdom.

865
01:30:25,030 --> 01:30:28,446
Your father loves you, Faramir.

866
01:30:29,159 --> 01:30:32,160
He will remember it before the end.

867
01:31:41,766 --> 01:31:43,308
Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

868
01:31:46,291 --> 01:31:47,785
Well...

869
01:31:48,335 --> 01:31:49,959
yes.

870
01:31:50,671 --> 01:31:54,418
At least, well enough for my own people.

871
01:31:56,050 --> 01:31:58,457
But we have no songs for great halls...

872
01:31:59,511 --> 01:32:00,756
and evil times.

873
01:32:01,596 --> 01:32:04,763
And why should your songs be unfit for my halls?

874
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:08,971
Come, sing me a song.

875
01:32:20,031 --> 01:32:23,363
Home is behind

876
01:32:23,532 --> 01:32:27,281
The world ahead

877
01:32:29,705 --> 01:32:35,540
And there are many paths to tread

878
01:32:37,336 --> 01:32:40,871
Through shadow

879
01:32:41,048 --> 01:32:45,212
To the edge of night

880
01:32:46,887 --> 01:32:51,964
Until the stars are all alight

881
01:32:54,978 --> 01:32:59,306
Mist and shadow

882
01:32:59,482 --> 01:33:03,775
Cloud and shade

883
01:33:06,154 --> 01:33:09,488
All shall fade

884
01:33:11,868 --> 01:33:15,865
All shall

885
01:33:21,627 --> 01:33:23,999
Fade

886
01:33:48,401 --> 01:33:51,852
March! March!

887
01:33:52,029 --> 01:33:57,236
March! March! March!

888
01:34:00,705 --> 01:34:03,030
Make way for the king.

889
01:34:04,541 --> 01:34:06,532
Make way.

890
01:34:09,002 --> 01:34:11,042
The king is here.

891
01:34:13,007 --> 01:34:14,631
My lord.

892
01:34:15,885 --> 01:34:17,841
Hail to you, sire.

893
01:34:18,304 --> 01:34:19,500
Grimbold, how many?

894
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:22,134
I bring 500 men from the Westfold, my lord.

895
01:34:23,099 --> 01:34:25,768
We have 300 more from Fenmarch, Theoden King.

896
01:34:26,894 --> 01:34:30,843
- Where are the riders from Snowborn?
- None have come, my lord.

897
01:34:47,914 --> 01:34:50,036
Six thousand spears.

898
01:34:51,082 --> 01:34:53,075
Less than half of what I'd hoped for.

899
01:34:53,376 --> 01:34:56,745
Six thousand will not be enough
to break the lines of Mordor.

900
01:34:59,507 --> 01:35:01,250
More will come.

901
01:35:01,634 --> 01:35:04,587
Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.

902
01:35:04,761 --> 01:35:07,334
We have till dawn, then we must ride.

903
01:35:26,823 --> 01:35:29,148
The horses are restless...

904
01:35:29,326 --> 01:35:30,820
and the men are quiet.

905
01:35:31,286 --> 01:35:34,404
They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain.

906
01:35:36,874 --> 01:35:38,747
That road there...

907
01:35:39,668 --> 01:35:41,744
where does that lead?

908
01:35:42,504 --> 01:35:46,336
It is the road to the Dimholt,
the door under the mountain.

909
01:35:47,050 --> 01:35:50,050
None who venture there ever return.

910
01:35:51,261 --> 01:35:53,135
That mountain is evil.

911
01:36:16,076 --> 01:36:17,902
Aragorn.

912
01:36:18,661 --> 01:36:20,570
Let's find some food.

913
01:36:37,053 --> 01:36:38,464
There.

914
01:36:39,430 --> 01:36:42,431
A true esquire of Rohan.

915
01:36:46,062 --> 01:36:48,053
I'm ready.

916
01:36:49,648 --> 01:36:50,927
Sorry.

917
01:36:51,108 --> 01:36:53,348
It isn't all that dangerous.

918
01:36:53,860 --> 01:36:56,185
It's not even sharp.

919
01:36:56,863 --> 01:37:00,279
Well, that's no good. You won't
kill many Orcs with a blunt blade.

920
01:37:00,450 --> 01:37:01,944
Come on.

921
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:08,612
To the smithy. Go!

922
01:37:10,083 --> 01:37:12,621
You should not encourage him.

923
01:37:12,794 --> 01:37:15,249
You should not doubt him.

924
01:37:15,422 --> 01:37:18,706
I do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his arm.

925
01:37:21,427 --> 01:37:23,004
Why should Merry be left behind?

926
01:37:23,178 --> 01:37:25,799
He has as much cause to go to war as you.

927
01:37:27,974 --> 01:37:31,140
Why can he not fight for those he loves?

928
01:37:34,396 --> 01:37:37,397
You know as little of war as that Hobbit.

929
01:37:38,650 --> 01:37:40,726
When the fear takes him...

930
01:37:40,902 --> 01:37:45,944
and the blood and the screams and
the horror of battle take hold...

931
01:37:46,324 --> 01:37:48,481
do you think he would stand and fight?

932
01:37:51,036 --> 01:37:52,661
He would flee.

933
01:37:52,830 --> 01:37:54,869
And he would be right to do so.

934
01:37:57,084 --> 01:38:01,034
War is the province of Men, Eowyn.

935
01:38:36,702 --> 01:38:40,403
I choose a mortal life.

936
01:38:43,334 --> 01:38:46,203
I wish I could've seen him...

937
01:38:47,337 --> 01:38:50,042
one last time.

938
01:39:01,224 --> 01:39:02,635
Sir?

939
01:39:04,478 --> 01:39:07,051
King Theoden awaits you, my lord.

940
01:39:27,832 --> 01:39:29,789
I take my leave.

941
01:39:44,430 --> 01:39:45,675
My lord Elrond.

942
01:39:46,265 --> 01:39:49,764
I come on behalf of one whom I love.

943
01:39:52,854 --> 01:39:54,847
Arwen is dying.

944
01:39:59,652 --> 01:40:03,696
She will not long survive the
evil that now spreads from Mordor.

945
01:40:04,448 --> 01:40:07,817
The light of the Evenstar is failing.

946
01:40:07,993 --> 01:40:11,991
As Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes.

947
01:40:12,164 --> 01:40:15,911
Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the Ring.

948
01:40:16,667 --> 01:40:19,240
The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn.

949
01:40:19,629 --> 01:40:21,288
The end has come.

950
01:40:21,673 --> 01:40:24,293
It will not be our end, but his.

951
01:40:25,050 --> 01:40:28,633
You ride to war, but not to victory.

952
01:40:29,637 --> 01:40:33,302
Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith, this you know.

953
01:40:33,474 --> 01:40:37,887
But in secret he sends another force
which will attack from the river.

954
01:40:38,354 --> 01:40:41,770
A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the south.

955
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:44,475
They'll be in the city in two days.

956
01:40:44,984 --> 01:40:47,819
You're outnumbered, Aragorn.

957
01:40:48,529 --> 01:40:50,653
You need more men.

958
01:40:51,032 --> 01:40:52,776
There are none.

959
01:40:54,535 --> 01:40:58,449
There are those who dwell in the mountain.

960
01:41:07,463 --> 01:41:09,622
Murderers...

961
01:41:09,799 --> 01:41:11,210
traitors.

962
01:41:13,678 --> 01:41:15,835
You would call upon them to fight?

963
01:41:16,012 --> 01:41:17,590
They believe in nothing.

964
01:41:17,764 --> 01:41:19,887
They answer to no one.

965
01:41:20,058 --> 01:41:23,142
They will answer to the king of Gondor.

966
01:41:30,275 --> 01:41:35,400
Anduril, the Flame of the West,
forged from the shards of Narsil.

967
01:41:49,710 --> 01:41:54,123
Sauron will not have forgotten the Sword of Elendil.

968
01:42:08,185 --> 01:42:12,930
The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith.

969
01:42:13,107 --> 01:42:15,513
The man who can wield the power of this sword...

970
01:42:15,691 --> 01:42:19,558
can summon to him an army more
deadly than any that walks this earth.

971
01:42:21,405 --> 01:42:23,563
Put aside the Ranger.

972
01:42:23,741 --> 01:42:27,074
Become who you were born to be.

973
01:42:27,244 --> 01:42:29,236
Take the Dimholt road.

974
01:42:33,171 --> 01:42:35,557
[Sindarin] <i>Ónen i-Estel Edain.</i>
[English] I gave hope to Men.

975
01:42:39,303 --> 01:42:40,403
[Sindarin] <i>Ú-chebin...</i>
[English] I have kept...

976
01:42:41,989 --> 01:42:43,204
[Sindarin] <i>...Estel anim.</i>
[English] ...no hope for me.

977
01:42:55,269 --> 01:42:56,930
Why are you doing this?

978
01:42:57,396 --> 01:43:00,598
The war lies to the east. You
cannot leave on the eve of battle.

979
01:43:03,026 --> 01:43:05,101
You cannot abandon the men.

980
01:43:06,404 --> 01:43:07,981
Eowyn...

981
01:43:08,155 --> 01:43:10,362
We need you here.

982
01:43:11,492 --> 01:43:13,365
Why have you come?

983
01:43:15,036 --> 01:43:16,993
Do you not know?

984
01:43:26,297 --> 01:43:29,297
It is but a shadow and a thought that you love.

985
01:43:33,219 --> 01:43:35,628
I cannot give you what you seek.

986
01:43:49,151 --> 01:43:53,065
I have wished you joy since first I saw you.

987
01:44:12,213 --> 01:44:14,501
Just where do you think you're off to?

988
01:44:14,673 --> 01:44:16,002
Not this time.

989
01:44:16,175 --> 01:44:18,381
This time you must stay, Gimli.

990
01:44:21,097 --> 01:44:23,931
Have you learned nothing of
the stubbornness of Dwarves?

991
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:27,763
You might as well accept it.
We're going with you, laddie.

992
01:44:50,081 --> 01:44:52,239
- What's happening?
- Where is he going?

993
01:44:52,583 --> 01:44:54,457
Where's he going?

994
01:44:57,045 --> 01:44:59,084
I don't understand.

995
01:45:03,510 --> 01:45:05,301
Lord Aragorn!

996
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:08,424
Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

997
01:45:09,641 --> 01:45:11,716
He leaves because there is no hope.

998
01:45:12,392 --> 01:45:14,515
He leaves because he must.

999
01:45:14,685 --> 01:45:16,394
Too few have come.

1000
01:45:16,563 --> 01:45:18,721
We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.

1001
01:45:21,234 --> 01:45:22,894
No...

1002
01:45:23,319 --> 01:45:24,564
we cannot.

1003
01:45:27,447 --> 01:45:31,231
But we will meet them in battle nonetheless.

1004
01:45:45,672 --> 01:45:47,416
I have left instruction.

1005
01:45:50,093 --> 01:45:53,343
The people are to follow your rule in my stead.

1006
01:45:59,935 --> 01:46:02,177
Take up my seat in the Golden Hall.

1007
01:46:03,439 --> 01:46:06,274
Long may you defend Edoras...

1008
01:46:06,442 --> 01:46:08,767
if the battle goes ill.

1009
01:46:09,861 --> 01:46:13,276
What other duty would you have me do, my lord?

1010
01:46:15,491 --> 01:46:17,448
Duty?

1011
01:46:19,620 --> 01:46:20,948
No.

1012
01:46:29,253 --> 01:46:31,376
I would have you smile again...

1013
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:39,795
not grieve for those whose time has come.

1014
01:46:44,642 --> 01:46:48,141
You shall live to see these days renewed...

1015
01:46:52,483 --> 01:46:55,233
and no more despair.

1016
01:47:01,449 --> 01:47:05,149
What kind of army would linger in such a place?

1017
01:47:05,328 --> 01:47:07,155
One that is cursed.

1018
01:47:09,124 --> 01:47:11,660
Long ago, the Men of the Mountains swore an oath...

1019
01:47:12,083 --> 01:47:14,835
to the last king of Gondor...

1020
01:47:15,420 --> 01:47:16,997
to come to his aid...

1021
01:47:17,171 --> 01:47:18,879
to fight.

1022
01:47:19,382 --> 01:47:21,540
But when the time came...

1023
01:47:22,177 --> 01:47:24,796
when Gondor's need was dire...

1024
01:47:24,969 --> 01:47:26,843
they fled...

1025
01:47:27,013 --> 01:47:30,383
vanishing into the darkness of the mountain.

1026
01:47:31,434 --> 01:47:33,759
And so Isildur cursed them...

1027
01:47:35,313 --> 01:47:39,180
never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge.

1028
01:47:43,487 --> 01:47:46,653
Who shall call them from the grey twilight?

1029
01:47:47,115 --> 01:47:49,357
The forgotten people.

1030
01:47:49,534 --> 01:47:52,025
The heir of him to whom the oath they swore.

1031
01:47:52,496 --> 01:47:54,368
From the north shall he come.

1032
01:47:54,872 --> 01:47:56,531
Need shall drive him.

1033
01:47:57,625 --> 01:48:01,123
He shall pass the door to the Paths of the Dead.

1034
01:48:19,603 --> 01:48:22,889
The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.

1035
01:48:28,444 --> 01:48:30,401
The way is shut.

1036
01:48:31,155 --> 01:48:33,112
It was made by those who are dead.

1037
01:48:33,740 --> 01:48:35,982
And the Dead keep it.

1038
01:48:36,535 --> 01:48:38,077
The way is shut.

1039
01:48:49,422 --> 01:48:50,916
Brego!

1040
01:48:54,426 --> 01:48:57,130
I do not fear death.

1041
01:49:09,439 --> 01:49:11,847
Well, this is a thing unheard-of.

1042
01:49:12,025 --> 01:49:16,687
An Elf will go underground where a Dwarf dare not?

1043
01:49:16,863 --> 01:49:18,191
Oh.

1044
01:49:18,364 --> 01:49:21,199
Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.

1045
01:49:36,214 --> 01:49:38,455
We must ride light and swift.

1046
01:49:38,632 --> 01:49:40,375
It is a long road ahead.

1047
01:49:40,550 --> 01:49:43,635
And man and beast must reach the
end with the strength to fight.

1048
01:49:49,142 --> 01:49:52,143
Little Hobbits do not belong in war, Master Meriadoc.

1049
01:49:52,478 --> 01:49:54,470
All my friends have gone to battle.

1050
01:49:54,646 --> 01:49:56,520
I would be ashamed to be left behind.

1051
01:49:56,690 --> 01:49:58,813
It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith.

1052
01:49:58,984 --> 01:50:01,356
And none of my riders can bear you as a burden.

1053
01:50:02,362 --> 01:50:04,485
I want to fight.

1054
01:50:04,990 --> 01:50:06,982
I will say no more.

1055
01:50:23,798 --> 01:50:25,755
Ride with me.

1056
01:50:27,218 --> 01:50:28,628
My lady.

1057
01:50:28,802 --> 01:50:31,174
Form up! Move out!

1058
01:50:31,347 --> 01:50:34,550
Form up! Move out!

1059
01:50:37,643 --> 01:50:38,841
Ride!

1060
01:50:39,020 --> 01:50:41,974
Ride now to Gondor!

1061
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:52,800
[Black Speech] <i> Katmuda! </i>
[English]  Death to men!

1062
01:50:54,324 --> 01:50:55,624
[Black Speech] <i> Katmuda! </i>
[English]  Death to men!

1063
01:50:55,625 --> 01:50:56,225
[Black Speech] <i> Gorosh! </i>
[English]  Louder!

1064
01:50:56,226 --> 01:50:57,526
[Black Speech] <i> Katmuda! </i>
[English]  Death to men!

1065
01:50:57,527 --> 01:50:58,027
[Black Speech] <i> Gorosh! </i>
[English]  Louder!

1066
01:50:58,028 --> 01:50:59,328
[Black Speech] <i> Katmuda! </i>
[English]  Death to men!

1067
01:50:59,329 --> 01:51:00,829
[Black Speech] <i> Gorosh chadar! </i>
[English]  Loud enough!

1068
01:51:23,602 --> 01:51:25,345
What is it?

1069
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:27,062
What do you see?

1070
01:51:27,313 --> 01:51:29,436
I see shapes of men.

1071
01:51:32,110 --> 01:51:33,485
And of horses.

1072
01:51:34,237 --> 01:51:35,435
Where?

1073
01:51:35,613 --> 01:51:38,566
Pale banners like shreds of cloud.

1074
01:51:40,993 --> 01:51:43,198
Spears rise...

1075
01:51:43,828 --> 01:51:47,280
like winter-thickets through a shroud of mist.

1076
01:51:48,541 --> 01:51:50,699
The Dead are following.

1077
01:51:51,919 --> 01:51:53,413
They have been summoned.

1078
01:51:54,088 --> 01:51:55,914
The Dead?

1079
01:51:56,298 --> 01:51:58,006
Summoned?

1080
01:51:58,425 --> 01:52:00,299
I knew that.

1081
01:52:03,638 --> 01:52:05,382
Very good.

1082
01:52:06,099 --> 01:52:08,174
Very good! Legolas!

1083
01:52:46,135 --> 01:52:47,545
Do not look down.

1084
01:53:40,142 --> 01:53:45,267
Who enters my domain?

1085
01:53:49,026 --> 01:53:51,230
One who will have your allegiance.

1086
01:53:54,195 --> 01:53:59,534
The Dead do not suffer the living to pass.

1087
01:53:59,868 --> 01:54:02,537
You will suffer me.

1088
01:54:26,057 --> 01:54:29,427
The way is shut.

1089
01:54:30,604 --> 01:54:35,063
It was made by those who are dead.

1090
01:54:35,441 --> 01:54:39,604
And the Dead keep it.

1091
01:54:48,745 --> 01:54:51,829
The way is shut.

1092
01:54:53,583 --> 01:54:56,204
Now you must die.

1093
01:55:00,089 --> 01:55:02,924
I summon you to fulfill your oath.

1094
01:55:03,259 --> 01:55:08,215
None but the king of Gondor may command me.

1095
01:55:13,810 --> 01:55:15,967
That line was broken.

1096
01:55:18,606 --> 01:55:20,811
It has been remade.

1097
01:55:28,739 --> 01:55:30,282
Fight for us...

1098
01:55:30,450 --> 01:55:32,988
and regain your honor.

1099
01:55:37,163 --> 01:55:38,492
What say you?

1100
01:55:50,717 --> 01:55:52,259
What say you?

1101
01:55:53,011 --> 01:55:54,803
You waste your time, Aragorn.

1102
01:55:54,972 --> 01:55:58,138
They had no honor in life, they have none now in death.

1103
01:55:58,642 --> 01:56:01,133
I am Isildur's heir.

1104
01:56:01,687 --> 01:56:03,642
Fight for me...

1105
01:56:04,229 --> 01:56:07,812
and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.

1106
01:56:11,737 --> 01:56:13,694
What say you?

1107
01:56:21,620 --> 01:56:23,827
You have my word!

1108
01:56:24,122 --> 01:56:28,121
Fight, and I will release you from this living death!

1109
01:56:29,587 --> 01:56:31,081
What say you?!

1110
01:56:34,382 --> 01:56:37,336
Stand, you traitors!

1111
01:57:04,283 --> 01:57:05,315
Out!

1112
01:57:26,679 --> 01:57:28,257
Legolas!

1113
01:57:29,391 --> 01:57:30,588
Run!

1114
01:58:36,909 --> 01:58:38,984
We fight.

1115
01:58:49,337 --> 01:58:51,910
Open the gate! Quick!

1116
01:59:22,951 --> 01:59:24,943
Quick! Hurry!

1117
01:59:38,714 --> 01:59:40,339
Faramir!

1118
01:59:41,343 --> 01:59:44,592
Say not that he has fallen.

1119
01:59:45,763 --> 01:59:47,305
They were outnumbered.

1120
01:59:47,722 --> 01:59:49,300
None survived.

1121
01:59:50,016 --> 01:59:52,009
Fear.

1122
01:59:52,561 --> 01:59:55,764
The city is rank with it.

1123
01:59:58,108 --> 02:00:00,562
Let us ease their pain.

1124
02:00:00,818 --> 02:00:02,561
Release the prisoners.

1125
02:00:02,736 --> 02:00:04,694
Catapults!

1126
02:00:18,041 --> 02:00:21,493
My sons are spent.

1127
02:00:22,546 --> 02:00:25,463
My line has ended.

1128
02:00:28,302 --> 02:00:29,713
He's alive!

1129
02:00:29,886 --> 02:00:33,052
The House of Stewards has failed.

1130
02:00:33,222 --> 02:00:34,680
He needs medicine, my lord.

1131
02:00:35,725 --> 02:00:38,393
My line has ended!

1132
02:00:39,895 --> 02:00:41,888
My lord!

1133
02:00:55,410 --> 02:00:57,236
Rohan...

1134
02:00:57,995 --> 02:01:00,401
has deserted us.

1135
02:01:14,842 --> 02:01:18,045
Theoden's betrayed me.

1136
02:01:29,190 --> 02:01:31,016
Abandon your posts!

1137
02:01:32,067 --> 02:01:35,981
Flee! Flee for your lives!

1138
02:01:46,121 --> 02:01:47,663
Prepare for battle!

1139
02:01:48,206 --> 02:01:51,372
Hurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall!

1140
02:01:52,544 --> 02:01:54,501
Over here!

1141
02:01:55,255 --> 02:01:57,627
Return to your posts!

1142
02:02:08,433 --> 02:02:11,054
Send these foul beasts into the abyss.

1143
02:02:21,236 --> 02:02:22,695
Stay where you are.

1144
02:02:39,669 --> 02:02:41,080
We need more rubble!

1145
02:02:41,254 --> 02:02:43,128
Watch out!

1146
02:02:43,298 --> 02:02:45,835
Down to the lower levels. Quick!

1147
02:02:47,718 --> 02:02:49,260
Double up, men!

1148
02:03:58,240 --> 02:04:01,241
Hold them back! Do not give in to fear.

1149
02:04:01,744 --> 02:04:05,242
Stand to your posts! Fight!

1150
02:04:45,908 --> 02:04:47,532
Not at the towers!

1151
02:04:47,701 --> 02:04:50,702
Aim for the trolls! Kill the trolls!

1152
02:04:51,455 --> 02:04:53,282
Bring them down!

1153
02:05:28,404 --> 02:05:30,444
Fight them back!

1154
02:05:30,615 --> 02:05:32,608
Peregrin Took!

1155
02:05:33,493 --> 02:05:36,659
- Go back to the Citadel!
- They'd called us out to fight.

1156
02:05:52,344 --> 02:05:54,716
This is no place for a Hobbit.

1157
02:06:20,452 --> 02:06:21,911
Guard of the Citadel, indeed.

1158
02:06:22,538 --> 02:06:25,870
Now, back, up the hill. Quickly. Quick!

1159
02:06:37,217 --> 02:06:40,171
What are you doing, you useless scum?!

1160
02:06:40,345 --> 02:06:42,302
The door won't give. It's too strong.

1161
02:06:48,644 --> 02:06:51,051
Get back there and smash it down.

1162
02:06:51,229 --> 02:06:53,222
But nothing can breach it.

1163
02:06:56,150 --> 02:06:58,392
Grond will breach it.

1164
02:07:01,822 --> 02:07:03,898
Bring up the wolf's head.

1165
02:07:07,077 --> 02:07:12,415
Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!

1166
02:07:12,749 --> 02:07:16,581
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1167
02:07:18,504 --> 02:07:21,920
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1168
02:07:22,633 --> 02:07:26,297
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1169
02:07:26,719 --> 02:07:30,883
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1170
02:07:31,057 --> 02:07:34,758
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1171
02:07:49,716 --> 02:07:51,489
You may go no further.

1172
02:07:54,928 --> 02:07:57,431
You will not enter Gondor.

1173
02:07:58,056 --> 02:08:00,476
Who are you to deny us passage?

1174
02:08:00,559 --> 02:08:04,521
Legolas, fire a warning shot past the bosun's ear.

1175
02:08:06,294 --> 02:08:07,858
Mind your aim.

1176
02:08:14,592 --> 02:08:17,137
That's it. Right. We warned you.

1177
02:08:17,345 --> 02:08:19,326
Prepare to be boarded.

1178
02:08:21,099 --> 02:08:22,235
Boarded?

1179
02:08:22,246 --> 02:08:24,227
By you and whose army?

1180
02:08:25,686 --> 02:08:27,458
This army.

1181
02:08:44,662 --> 02:08:46,121
In there.

1182
02:08:48,207 --> 02:08:49,927
What is this place?

1183
02:08:54,462 --> 02:08:57,746
Master must go inside the tunnel.

1184
02:08:59,415 --> 02:09:02,908
Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.

1185
02:09:05,566 --> 02:09:07,287
It's the only way.

1186
02:09:09,893 --> 02:09:11,665
Go in...

1187
02:09:12,145 --> 02:09:14,351
or go back.

1188
02:09:17,191 --> 02:09:19,812
I can't go back.

1189
02:09:32,622 --> 02:09:35,166
- What's that smell?
- Orcses' filth.

1190
02:09:35,177 --> 02:09:38,124
Orcses come in here sometimes.

1191
02:09:43,726 --> 02:09:44,977
Hurry.

1192
02:09:50,242 --> 02:09:51,806
This way.

1193
02:09:54,829 --> 02:09:56,445
Smeagol?

1194
02:09:57,592 --> 02:09:59,573
Over here.

1195
02:10:08,696 --> 02:10:11,042
It's sticky. What is it?

1196
02:10:11,824 --> 02:10:13,544
You will see.

1197
02:10:14,118 --> 02:10:15,995
Oh, yes.

1198
02:10:16,464 --> 02:10:19,328
You will see.

1199
02:10:28,610 --> 02:10:30,174
Smeagol?

1200
02:10:31,947 --> 02:10:32,972
Smeagol!

1201
02:10:35,596 --> 02:10:37,265
Smeagol!

1202
02:10:46,856 --> 02:10:48,313
Sam.

1203
02:12:28,772 --> 02:12:31,087
And you, Frodo Baggins...

1204
02:12:31,097 --> 02:12:36,033
I give you the light of
Earendil, our most beloved star.

1205
02:12:37,269 --> 02:12:40,491
May it be a light for you in dark places...

1206
02:12:40,532 --> 02:12:43,622
when all other lights go out.

1207
02:12:44,055 --> 02:12:47,600
[Quenya] <i>Aiya Eärendil, Elenion Ancalima!</i>
[English] Hail Eärendil, Brightest of the Stars!

1208
02:14:00,626 --> 02:14:03,443
Naughty little fly.

1209
02:14:04,067 --> 02:14:07,403
Why does he cry?

1210
02:14:07,820 --> 02:14:11,000
Caught in a web

1211
02:14:11,417 --> 02:14:13,627
Soon you'll be...

1212
02:14:14,003 --> 02:14:15,830
Eaten.

1213
02:14:53,956 --> 02:14:55,874
Got away, did it, precious?

1214
02:14:56,302 --> 02:14:58,074
Not this time.

1215
02:14:58,283 --> 02:15:01,252
- Not this time!
- No!

1216
02:15:08,552 --> 02:15:11,427
It wasn't us. It wasn't us!

1217
02:15:12,358 --> 02:15:14,913
Smeagol wouldn't hurt master.

1218
02:15:15,069 --> 02:15:16,592
We promised.

1219
02:15:17,050 --> 02:15:19,499
You must believe us.

1220
02:15:19,604 --> 02:15:21,145
It was the precious.

1221
02:15:21,950 --> 02:15:26,106
The precious made us do it.

1222
02:15:43,532 --> 02:15:46,127
I have to destroy it, Smeagol.

1223
02:15:55,574 --> 02:15:58,470
I have to destroy it for both our sakes.

1224
02:16:08,920 --> 02:16:09,977
No!

1225
02:16:33,526 --> 02:16:35,620
I'm so sorry, Sam.

1226
02:16:40,511 --> 02:16:42,667
I'm so sorry.

1227
02:17:08,974 --> 02:17:13,239
This task was appointed to you, Frodo of the Shire.

1228
02:17:14,761 --> 02:17:16,899
If you do not find a way...

1229
02:17:18,410 --> 02:17:20,026
no one will.

1230
02:17:53,755 --> 02:17:55,870
The scouts report Minas Tirith is surrounded.

1231
02:17:56,361 --> 02:17:58,327
The lower level's in flames.

1232
02:17:59,072 --> 02:18:01,246
Everywhere, legions of the enemy advance.

1233
02:18:02,044 --> 02:18:03,242
Time is against us.

1234
02:18:03,294 --> 02:18:04,539
Make ready!

1235
02:18:04,806 --> 02:18:06,539
Take heart, Merry.

1236
02:18:06,892 --> 02:18:08,925
It will soon be over.

1237
02:18:09,988 --> 02:18:11,219
My lady...

1238
02:18:11,969 --> 02:18:14,347
you are fair and brave...

1239
02:18:14,868 --> 02:18:17,110
and have much to live for...

1240
02:18:18,725 --> 02:18:20,757
and many who love you.

1241
02:18:23,939 --> 02:18:26,273
I know it is too late to turn aside.

1242
02:18:27,432 --> 02:18:30,019
I know there is not much point now in hoping.

1243
02:18:31,394 --> 02:18:34,990
If I were a knight of Rohan, capable of great deeds...

1244
02:18:34,991 --> 02:18:37,943
But
- I'm not.

1245
02:18:38,379 --> 02:18:39,953
I'm a Hobbit.

1246
02:18:43,102 --> 02:18:45,167
And I know I can't save Middle-earth.

1247
02:18:48,961 --> 02:18:50,869
I just want to help my friends.

1248
02:18:53,288 --> 02:18:54,459
Frodo.

1249
02:18:55,791 --> 02:18:57,050
Sam.

1250
02:18:59,127 --> 02:19:00,677
Pippin.

1251
02:19:02,463 --> 02:19:05,695
More than anything, I wish I could see them again.

1252
02:19:09,657 --> 02:19:11,722
Prepare to move out!

1253
02:19:12,097 --> 02:19:15,340
Make haste. We ride through the night.

1254
02:19:31,760 --> 02:19:32,751
To battle.

1255
02:19:33,428 --> 02:19:34,732
To battle.

1256
02:19:58,035 --> 02:19:59,399
Back to the gate!

1257
02:20:00,120 --> 02:20:01,850
Hurry!

1258
02:20:22,015 --> 02:20:26,250
I am steward of the House of Anarion.

1259
02:20:26,707 --> 02:20:28,896
Thus have I walked.

1260
02:20:30,356 --> 02:20:33,275
And thus now will I sleep.

1261
02:20:39,479 --> 02:20:41,268
Gondor is lost.

1262
02:20:41,981 --> 02:20:45,182
There is no hope for Men.

1263
02:21:00,331 --> 02:21:02,623
Why do the fools fly?

1264
02:21:04,553 --> 02:21:07,252
Better to die sooner than late.

1265
02:21:09,714 --> 02:21:11,457
For die we must.

1266
02:21:24,103 --> 02:21:27,439
No tomb for Denethor and Faramir.

1267
02:21:28,273 --> 02:21:33,799
No long, slow sleep of death embalmed.

1268
02:21:34,476 --> 02:21:39,105
We shall burn, like the heathen kings of old.

1269
02:21:43,235 --> 02:21:44,613
Bring wood and oil.

1270
02:21:47,874 --> 02:21:48,784
Steady.

1271
02:21:49,490 --> 02:21:50,998
Steady.

1272
02:22:05,859 --> 02:22:08,153
You are soldiers of Gondor.

1273
02:22:08,674 --> 02:22:13,001
No matter what comes through that
gate, you will stand your ground.

1274
02:22:19,277 --> 02:22:20,278
Run!

1275
02:22:22,697 --> 02:22:24,001
Volley!

1276
02:22:24,908 --> 02:22:26,323
Fire!

1277
02:24:19,992 --> 02:24:21,712
Let him go, you filth.

1278
02:24:23,766 --> 02:24:25,153
Let him go!

1279
02:24:26,769 --> 02:24:28,853
You will not touch him again.

1280
02:24:32,138 --> 02:24:33,598
Come on and finish it.

1281
02:26:23,750 --> 02:26:24,874
Back!

1282
02:26:36,105 --> 02:26:37,252
Mr. Frodo.

1283
02:26:47,052 --> 02:26:48,513
Oh, no.

1284
02:26:49,138 --> 02:26:50,646
Frodo.

1285
02:26:51,275 --> 02:26:52,815
Mr. Frodo.

1286
02:26:57,760 --> 02:26:58,886
Wake up.

1287
02:27:03,004 --> 02:27:05,142
Don't leave me here alone.

1288
02:27:06,967 --> 02:27:09,104
Don't go where I can't follow.

1289
02:27:13,535 --> 02:27:14,682
Wake up.

1290
02:27:21,615 --> 02:27:23,544
Not asleep.

1291
02:27:25,889 --> 02:27:27,610
Dead.

1292
02:27:46,534 --> 02:27:48,410
You get back, you scum!

1293
02:27:57,846 --> 02:27:59,410
What's this?

1294
02:28:00,265 --> 02:28:03,163
Looks like old Shelob's been having a bit of fun.

1295
02:28:04,988 --> 02:28:07,334
Killed another one, has she?

1296
02:28:07,647 --> 02:28:09,472
No.

1297
02:28:12,390 --> 02:28:14,491
This fellow ain't dead.

1298
02:28:14,496 --> 02:28:16,665
Not dead?

1299
02:28:17,186 --> 02:28:22,608
- She jabs him with her stinger,
and he goes as limp as a boned fish.

1300
02:28:23,286 --> 02:28:25,892
Then she has her way with them.

1301
02:28:26,465 --> 02:28:28,499
That's how she likes to feed.

1302
02:28:28,655 --> 02:28:30,584
Fresh blood.

1303
02:28:30,793 --> 02:28:32,982
Get him to the tower!

1304
02:28:36,684 --> 02:28:38,435
Samwise, you fool.

1305
02:28:38,477 --> 02:28:41,323
This scum will be awake in a couple of hours.

1306
02:28:41,635 --> 02:28:43,877
Then he'll wish he'd never been born.

1307
02:29:08,379 --> 02:29:11,402
The house of his spirit crumbles.

1308
02:29:12,758 --> 02:29:14,009
He is burning.

1309
02:29:15,312 --> 02:29:16,668
Already burning.

1310
02:29:17,033 --> 02:29:18,597
He's not dead.

1311
02:29:19,379 --> 02:29:20,943
He's not dead!

1312
02:29:23,028 --> 02:29:24,704
No! No!

1313
02:29:25,217 --> 02:29:27,198
No! No!

1314
02:29:27,667 --> 02:29:29,648
He's not dead!

1315
02:29:30,169 --> 02:29:33,454
- Farewell, Peregrin, son of Paladin.
- No! No! No!

1316
02:29:33,662 --> 02:29:36,791
I release you from my service.

1317
02:29:38,146 --> 02:29:42,472
Go now and die in what way seems best to you.

1318
02:29:44,829 --> 02:29:46,883
Pour oil on the wood!

1319
02:29:48,780 --> 02:29:50,643
Come on, soldier! Move it!

1320
02:29:51,387 --> 02:29:54,064
- Hurry along there! Hurry along!
- Gandalf!

1321
02:29:54,723 --> 02:29:55,974
Where is Gandalf?

1322
02:29:57,434 --> 02:29:58,476
Gandalf!

1323
02:30:04,263 --> 02:30:05,306
Retreat!

1324
02:30:07,496 --> 02:30:09,215
The city is breached!

1325
02:30:09,371 --> 02:30:12,291
Fall back! To the second level!

1326
02:30:16,149 --> 02:30:17,921
Get the women and children out!

1327
02:30:18,026 --> 02:30:19,694
Get them out!

1328
02:30:19,965 --> 02:30:21,310
Retreat!

1329
02:30:21,414 --> 02:30:23,396
Come on. Come on, move.

1330
02:30:23,604 --> 02:30:27,930
Move into the city. Kill all in your path.

1331
02:30:36,011 --> 02:30:38,253
Take them down!

1332
02:30:59,052 --> 02:31:01,868
Fight! Fight to the last man!

1333
02:31:02,024 --> 02:31:03,536
Fight for your lives!

1334
02:31:03,946 --> 02:31:04,879
Gandalf!

1335
02:31:09,134 --> 02:31:10,312
Gandalf!

1336
02:31:10,417 --> 02:31:13,076
Denethor has lost his mind!

1337
02:31:13,284 --> 02:31:15,474
He's burning Faramir alive!

1338
02:31:15,515 --> 02:31:17,455
Up! Quickly!

1339
02:31:24,544 --> 02:31:25,743
Go back to the abyss.

1340
02:31:27,568 --> 02:31:30,904
Fall into the nothingness that
awaits you and your master.

1341
02:31:31,257 --> 02:31:37,578
Do you not know death when you see it, old man?

1342
02:31:37,785 --> 02:31:41,821
This is my hour.

1343
02:31:52,070 --> 02:31:53,059
Gandalf!

1344
02:32:02,308 --> 02:32:05,520
You have failed.

1345
02:32:06,583 --> 02:32:11,462
The world of Men will fall.

1346
02:33:08,649 --> 02:33:09,743
Courage, Merry.

1347
02:33:10,317 --> 02:33:12,403
Courage for our friends.

1348
02:33:16,230 --> 02:33:19,358
Form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks!

1349
02:33:19,389 --> 02:33:22,568
Pikes in front. Archers behind.

1350
02:33:30,805 --> 02:33:33,985
Eomer, take your Eored down the left flank.

1351
02:33:34,225 --> 02:33:35,289
Flank ready.

1352
02:33:35,758 --> 02:33:38,207
Gamling, follow the king's banner down the center.

1353
02:33:38,364 --> 02:33:42,170
Grimbold, take your company
right after you pass the wall.

1354
02:33:42,482 --> 02:33:44,881
Forth, and fear no darkness!

1355
02:33:45,298 --> 02:33:48,947
Arise, arise, Riders of Theoden!

1356
02:33:49,322 --> 02:33:54,472
Spears shall be shaken...
Shields shall be splintered...

1357
02:33:54,785 --> 02:33:58,278
a sword-day, a red day...

1358
02:33:58,601 --> 02:34:01,955
and the sun rises!

1359
02:34:10,007 --> 02:34:14,491
Whatever happens, stay with me. I'll look after you.

1360
02:34:20,695 --> 02:34:22,727
Ride now!

1361
02:34:24,239 --> 02:34:26,101
Ride now!

1362
02:34:26,950 --> 02:34:29,765
Ride! Ride for ruin...

1363
02:34:29,974 --> 02:34:33,154
and the world's ending!

1364
02:34:34,561 --> 02:34:38,471
- Death!
- Death!

1365
02:34:39,565 --> 02:34:42,641
- Death!
- Death!

1366
02:34:43,413 --> 02:34:45,248
- Death!
- Death!

1367
02:34:45,665 --> 02:34:49,940
- Death!
- Death!

1368
02:34:54,058 --> 02:34:56,560
For Eorlingas!

1369
02:35:39,672 --> 02:35:40,976
Fire!

1370
02:35:45,198 --> 02:35:47,023
Death!

1371
02:35:50,567 --> 02:35:52,288
Charge!

1372
02:35:52,340 --> 02:35:53,427
Fire at will!

1373
02:36:51,404 --> 02:36:54,271
Set a fire in our flesh.

1374
02:37:12,173 --> 02:37:13,821
Stay this madness!

1375
02:37:18,242 --> 02:37:22,578
You may triumph in the field of battle for a day...

1376
02:37:23,214 --> 02:37:26,749
but against the power that has risen in the east...

1377
02:37:27,114 --> 02:37:29,981
there is no victory.

1378
02:37:59,539 --> 02:38:01,208
No!

1379
02:38:01,270 --> 02:38:04,126
You will not take my son from me!

1380
02:38:04,157 --> 02:38:06,264
No!

1381
02:38:17,473 --> 02:38:18,879
Faramir.

1382
02:38:32,695 --> 02:38:36,395
So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.

1383
02:39:04,337 --> 02:39:06,423
Drive them to the river!

1384
02:39:08,769 --> 02:39:11,063
Make safe the city!

1385
02:39:50,838 --> 02:39:52,558
Re-form the line!

1386
02:39:53,758 --> 02:39:55,634
Re-form the line!

1387
02:40:02,828 --> 02:40:05,591
Sound the charge! Take them head-on!

1388
02:40:06,060 --> 02:40:08,250
Charge!

1389
02:41:27,072 --> 02:41:28,323
Cut him down!

1390
02:41:55,327 --> 02:41:57,777
Take the reins. Pull him left!

1391
02:42:00,175 --> 02:42:01,269
Left!

1392
02:42:19,046 --> 02:42:20,506
Aim for their heads!

1393
02:42:26,553 --> 02:42:29,890
Bring it down! Bring it down! Bring it down!

1394
02:42:35,571 --> 02:42:36,510
Merry!

1395
02:42:43,756 --> 02:42:45,163
Merry!

1396
02:43:58,616 --> 02:44:00,544
I didn't think it would end this way.

1397
02:44:01,900 --> 02:44:03,359
End?

1398
02:44:04,736 --> 02:44:06,957
No, the journey doesn't end here.

1399
02:44:09,240 --> 02:44:12,170
Death is just another path...

1400
02:44:13,036 --> 02:44:15,037
one that we all must take.

1401
02:44:16,006 --> 02:44:19,572
The grey rain curtain of this world rolls back...

1402
02:44:19,676 --> 02:44:23,117
and all turns to silver glass.

1403
02:44:25,411 --> 02:44:27,184
And then you see it.

1404
02:44:29,101 --> 02:44:31,614
What, Gandalf?

1405
02:44:32,782 --> 02:44:34,221
See what?

1406
02:44:35,342 --> 02:44:37,349
White shores...

1407
02:44:39,226 --> 02:44:41,468
and beyond.

1408
02:44:43,032 --> 02:44:44,907
A far green country...

1409
02:44:45,669 --> 02:44:48,400
under a swift sunrise.

1410
02:44:52,571 --> 02:44:54,292
Well...

1411
02:44:54,344 --> 02:44:55,908
that isn't so bad.

1412
02:44:55,929 --> 02:44:57,211
No.

1413
02:44:59,556 --> 02:45:01,172
No, it isn't.

1414
02:45:17,489 --> 02:45:20,878
Rally to me! To me!

1415
02:45:41,835 --> 02:45:46,213
Feast on his flesh.

1416
02:45:50,645 --> 02:45:52,782
I will kill you if you touch him.

1417
02:45:52,793 --> 02:45:58,308
Do not come between the Nazgul and his prey.

1418
02:47:07,277 --> 02:47:10,666
Late as usual, pirate scum!

1419
02:47:10,900 --> 02:47:12,698
There's knife-work here needs doing.

1420
02:47:12,750 --> 02:47:16,569
Come on, you sea rats! Get off your ships!

1421
02:47:31,700 --> 02:47:34,076
There's plenty for the both of us.

1422
02:47:34,176 --> 02:47:36,522
May the best Dwarf win.

1423
02:47:53,882 --> 02:47:56,108
You fool.

1424
02:47:56,279 --> 02:47:59,695
No man can kill me.

1425
02:48:02,066 --> 02:48:05,243
Die now.

1426
02:48:15,881 --> 02:48:17,915
I am no man.

1427
02:48:34,440 --> 02:48:37,939
- 15! 16!
- 17!

1428
02:48:45,741 --> 02:48:47,651
Merry!

1429
02:49:29,656 --> 02:49:31,448
Legolas!

1430
02:49:53,846 --> 02:49:56,217
33, 34.

1431
02:50:43,307 --> 02:50:45,679
That still only counts as one!

1432
02:50:45,809 --> 02:50:48,009
Come on, then. Come on!

1433
02:51:31,726 --> 02:51:34,561
I know your face...

1434
02:51:36,345 --> 02:51:38,266
Eowyn.

1435
02:51:40,859 --> 02:51:43,231
My eyes darken.

1436
02:51:44,321 --> 02:51:45,759
No.

1437
02:51:46,573 --> 02:51:48,262
No.

1438
02:51:50,269 --> 02:51:52,776
I am going to save you.

1439
02:51:54,100 --> 02:51:56,446
You already did.

1440
02:52:00,127 --> 02:52:01,751
Eowyn...

1441
02:52:03,203 --> 02:52:05,746
my body is broken.

1442
02:52:10,756 --> 02:52:13,258
You have to let me go.

1443
02:52:19,123 --> 02:52:21,718
I go to my fathers...

1444
02:52:23,168 --> 02:52:26,024
in whose mighty company...

1445
02:52:26,442 --> 02:52:29,817
I shall not now feel ashamed.

1446
02:52:46,388 --> 02:52:48,043
Eowyn.

1447
02:53:34,505 --> 02:53:37,002
Release us.

1448
02:53:38,857 --> 02:53:40,632
Bad idea.

1449
02:53:40,786 --> 02:53:44,513
Very handy in a tight spot, these
lads, despite the fact they're dead.

1450
02:53:44,539 --> 02:53:46,798
You gave us your word.

1451
02:53:48,475 --> 02:53:50,665
I hold your oath fulfilled.

1452
02:53:51,889 --> 02:53:53,348
Go.

1453
02:53:54,053 --> 02:53:55,890
Be at peace.

1454
02:54:39,188 --> 02:54:41,127
Merry.

1455
02:54:41,701 --> 02:54:45,037
No!

1456
02:54:48,582 --> 02:54:51,344
No!

1457
02:55:14,992 --> 02:55:18,922
With a sigh.

1458
02:55:19,037 --> 02:55:22,799
You turn away.

1459
02:55:22,936 --> 02:55:26,971
With a deepening heart.

1460
02:55:27,002 --> 02:55:31,903
No more words to say.

1461
02:55:32,028 --> 02:55:35,552
You will find.

1462
02:55:35,603 --> 02:55:44,101
That the world has changed forever.

1463
02:56:08,790 --> 02:56:16,600
And the trees are now turning from green to gold.

1464
02:56:20,467 --> 02:56:25,284
And the sun is now fading.

1465
02:56:25,389 --> 02:56:35,460
I wish I could hold you closer.

1466
02:56:38,291 --> 02:56:39,568
Merry!

1467
02:56:41,111 --> 02:56:43,218
Merry!

1468
02:56:54,561 --> 02:56:56,388
Merry.

1469
02:56:58,857 --> 02:57:00,102
Merry, it's me.

1470
02:57:02,715 --> 02:57:04,278
It's Pippin.

1471
02:57:06,780 --> 02:57:09,069
I knew you'd find me.

1472
02:57:09,241 --> 02:57:10,439
Yes.

1473
02:57:12,870 --> 02:57:14,946
Are you going to leave me?

1474
02:57:15,497 --> 02:57:17,205
No, Merry.

1475
02:57:18,500 --> 02:57:20,741
I'm going to look after you.

1476
02:58:04,437 --> 02:58:06,160
Hands off!

1477
02:58:06,314 --> 02:58:09,501
That shiny shirt, that's mine.

1478
02:58:09,754 --> 02:58:13,918
It's going to the Great Eye,
along with everything else.

1479
02:58:15,437 --> 02:58:19,346
I don't take orders from stinking Morgul-rats!

1480
02:58:20,128 --> 02:58:25,289
You touch it, and I'll stick this blade in your gut.

1481
02:58:45,777 --> 02:58:47,706
The scum tried to knife me.

1482
02:58:47,758 --> 02:58:49,699
Kill him!

1483
03:00:32,853 --> 03:00:34,919
That's for Frodo!

1484
03:00:35,199 --> 03:00:37,426
And for the Shire!

1485
03:00:40,830 --> 03:00:43,140
And that's for my old Gaffer!

1486
03:01:12,577 --> 03:01:15,963
Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.

1487
03:01:17,060 --> 03:01:21,800
I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.

1488
03:01:29,051 --> 03:01:30,805
Not if I stick you first.

1489
03:01:30,928 --> 03:01:32,491
Sam!

1490
03:01:37,548 --> 03:01:39,633
Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.

1491
03:01:39,685 --> 03:01:41,818
Sorry for everything.

1492
03:01:42,031 --> 03:01:45,988
- Let's get you out of here.
- It's too late. It's over.

1493
03:01:46,098 --> 03:01:49,030
They've taken it. Sam...

1494
03:01:49,798 --> 03:01:51,324
they took the Ring.

1495
03:01:52,040 --> 03:01:54,786
Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

1496
03:02:06,741 --> 03:02:08,968
I thought I'd lost you.

1497
03:02:09,348 --> 03:02:11,055
So I took it.

1498
03:02:12,215 --> 03:02:14,301
Only for safekeeping.

1499
03:02:15,552 --> 03:02:17,304
Give it to me.

1500
03:02:20,816 --> 03:02:23,064
Give me the Ring, Sam.

1501
03:02:27,698 --> 03:02:28,984
Sam.

1502
03:02:30,565 --> 03:02:32,532
Give me the Ring.

1503
03:02:53,242 --> 03:02:54,543
You must understand.

1504
03:02:58,038 --> 03:02:59,886
The Ring is my burden.

1505
03:03:01,061 --> 03:03:03,219
It will destroy you, Sam.

1506
03:03:06,378 --> 03:03:08,356
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1507
03:03:09,663 --> 03:03:11,319
We best find you some clothes.

1508
03:03:11,488 --> 03:03:14,524
You can't go walking through
Mordor in naught but your skin.

1509
03:03:36,260 --> 03:03:38,466
We did it, Mr. Frodo.

1510
03:03:38,971 --> 03:03:41,259
We made it to Mordor.

1511
03:03:42,599 --> 03:03:44,259
There are so many of them.

1512
03:03:45,226 --> 03:03:47,799
We'll never get through unseen.

1513
03:03:52,931 --> 03:03:56,275
It's him, the Eye.

1514
03:04:03,993 --> 03:04:06,615
We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.

1515
03:04:07,080 --> 03:04:09,119
There's nothing for it.

1516
03:04:12,126 --> 03:04:16,538
Come on. Let's just make it down the hill for starters.

1517
03:04:25,722 --> 03:04:29,139
Frodo has passed beyond my sight.

1518
03:04:30,413 --> 03:04:33,280
The darkness is deepening.

1519
03:04:33,332 --> 03:04:35,626
If Sauron had the Ring, we would know it.

1520
03:04:35,637 --> 03:04:38,062
It's only a matter of time.

1521
03:04:39,536 --> 03:04:41,975
He has suffered a defeat, yes but...

1522
03:04:43,029 --> 03:04:47,512
behind the walls of Mordor, our enemy is regrouping.

1523
03:04:47,668 --> 03:04:49,441
Let him stay there.

1524
03:04:49,451 --> 03:04:52,329
Let him rot! Why should we care?

1525
03:04:52,392 --> 03:04:57,730
Because 10,000 Orcs now stand
between Frodo and Mount Doom.

1526
03:05:04,402 --> 03:05:06,956
I've sent him to his death.

1527
03:05:08,469 --> 03:05:09,791
No.

1528
03:05:10,294 --> 03:05:12,712
There is still hope for Frodo.

1529
03:05:13,057 --> 03:05:17,184
He needs time and safe passage
across the plains of Gorgoroth.

1530
03:05:18,269 --> 03:05:20,842
- We can give him that.
- How?

1531
03:05:21,189 --> 03:05:23,893
Draw out Sauron's armies.

1532
03:05:24,056 --> 03:05:26,189
Empty his lands.

1533
03:05:26,402 --> 03:05:29,485
Then we gather our full strength
and march on the Black Gate.

1534
03:05:30,050 --> 03:05:33,114
We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms.

1535
03:05:33,283 --> 03:05:34,860
Not for ourselves.

1536
03:05:35,055 --> 03:05:40,663
But we can give Frodo his chance if
we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.

1537
03:05:42,458 --> 03:05:46,241
Keep him blind to all else that moves.

1538
03:05:46,993 --> 03:05:48,202
A diversion.

1539
03:05:48,349 --> 03:05:50,171
Certainty of death...

1540
03:05:50,278 --> 03:05:53,092
small chance of success...

1541
03:05:53,927 --> 03:05:55,546
what are we waiting for?

1542
03:05:56,117 --> 03:05:58,544
Sauron will suspect a trap.

1543
03:05:59,348 --> 03:06:01,387
He will not take the bait.

1544
03:06:02,893 --> 03:06:05,384
Oh, I think he will.

1545
03:06:39,698 --> 03:06:42,409
Long have you hunted me.

1546
03:06:42,616 --> 03:06:44,597
Long have I eluded you.

1547
03:06:46,214 --> 03:06:48,010
No more.

1548
03:06:49,655 --> 03:06:52,135
Behold the Sword of Elendil.

1549
03:07:36,624 --> 03:07:39,136
The city has fallen silent.

1550
03:07:40,795 --> 03:07:43,851
There is no warmth left in the sun.

1551
03:07:44,652 --> 03:07:46,360
It grows so cold.

1552
03:07:49,344 --> 03:07:52,401
It's just the damp of the first spring rain.

1553
03:07:58,780 --> 03:08:01,993
I do not believe this darkness will endure.

1554
03:08:30,579 --> 03:08:32,195
Look, the Orcs...

1555
03:08:32,665 --> 03:08:34,730
they're moving off.

1556
03:08:35,782 --> 03:08:37,858
You see, Mr. Frodo...

1557
03:08:38,035 --> 03:08:40,360
some luck at last.

1558
03:08:40,537 --> 03:08:42,363
Move it, you slugs!

1559
03:08:43,612 --> 03:08:47,033
Come on! Faster!

1560
03:08:54,925 --> 03:08:58,156
Come along, you coldhearted wretched scum...

1561
03:08:58,167 --> 03:09:02,716
I'll whip you down to the bone, you...

1562
03:09:05,560 --> 03:09:07,228
Come on!

1563
03:09:07,395 --> 03:09:09,606
What have I told you?

1564
03:09:09,626 --> 03:09:11,919
No evation...

1565
03:09:12,909 --> 03:09:14,734
Now move it!

1566
03:09:16,559 --> 03:09:18,063
Get up!

1567
03:09:18,436 --> 03:09:21,115
Come on, you slugs!

1568
03:09:21,251 --> 03:09:24,900
You two are going straight to the front line!

1569
03:09:25,078 --> 03:09:30,373
Now, move it! Go on! Fall
in! Move it! Move it! Move it!

1570
03:09:42,937 --> 03:09:46,743
To the Gate, you slugs! Now, move it!

1571
03:09:56,178 --> 03:09:59,771
Don't you know we're at war?

1572
03:10:22,088 --> 03:10:24,957
Company, halt!

1573
03:10:28,760 --> 03:10:32,170
Inspection!

1574
03:10:32,305 --> 03:10:34,802
Sam, help me.

1575
03:10:34,964 --> 03:10:36,801
Mr. Frodo!

1576
03:10:39,499 --> 03:10:42,057
Stand up, Mr. Frodo. Stand up!

1577
03:10:42,209 --> 03:10:44,057
It's so heavy.

1578
03:10:53,158 --> 03:10:54,362
Oh, no.

1579
03:10:59,986 --> 03:11:01,989
What do I do? What do we do?

1580
03:11:05,043 --> 03:11:06,206
- Hit me.
- What?

1581
03:11:06,347 --> 03:11:08,417
Hit me, Sam. Start fighting.

1582
03:11:08,588 --> 03:11:10,165
Get off of me!

1583
03:11:10,829 --> 03:11:13,165
Nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot.

1584
03:11:21,777 --> 03:11:23,848
Get off of me!

1585
03:11:24,748 --> 03:11:26,678
Break it up! Break it up!

1586
03:11:29,232 --> 03:11:33,852
Oi! I'll have your guts if you
don't shut this rabble down!

1587
03:11:33,872 --> 03:11:36,311
Go, Sam. Now!

1588
03:11:45,236 --> 03:11:46,788
Move along, scum!

1589
03:11:46,956 --> 03:11:48,865
Back in the line!

1590
03:11:49,354 --> 03:11:51,167
You maggots!

1591
03:11:51,805 --> 03:11:54,836
Get back into the line, you slugs!

1592
03:11:57,174 --> 03:12:00,708
Dig it, you slugs. Move it.

1593
03:12:49,409 --> 03:12:51,553
I can't...

1594
03:12:51,703 --> 03:12:55,471
I can't... I can't manage the Ring, Sam.

1595
03:12:55,560 --> 03:12:56,800
It's... It's...

1596
03:12:56,968 --> 03:12:59,551
It's such a weight to carry.

1597
03:13:00,408 --> 03:13:01,471
It's...

1598
03:13:01,608 --> 03:13:03,606
Such a weight.

1599
03:13:08,540 --> 03:13:11,043
We're going that way. Straight as we can.

1600
03:13:12,398 --> 03:13:15,631
There's no point carrying
anything we're not sure to need.

1601
03:13:30,696 --> 03:13:32,627
Mr. Frodo.

1602
03:13:34,085 --> 03:13:35,631
Look.

1603
03:13:38,099 --> 03:13:40,050
There is light...

1604
03:13:40,392 --> 03:13:41,956
and beauty up there...

1605
03:13:42,217 --> 03:13:44,686
that no shadow can touch.

1606
03:14:35,704 --> 03:14:37,359
Take mine.

1607
03:14:37,840 --> 03:14:39,984
There's a few drops left.

1608
03:14:55,148 --> 03:14:57,784
There will be none left for the return journey.

1609
03:14:58,693 --> 03:15:01,881
I don't think there will be
a return journey, Mr. Frodo.

1610
03:15:36,400 --> 03:15:38,400
[Black Speech] <i> Kelkum-ishi. </i>
[English]  In the coldness.

1611
03:15:54,733 --> 03:15:56,923
Frodo, get down!

1612
03:15:58,643 --> 03:16:00,594
Hide!

1613
03:16:10,738 --> 03:16:12,777
Frodo!

1614
03:16:18,558 --> 03:16:20,031
Where are they?

1615
03:16:56,091 --> 03:16:59,149
Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!

1616
03:17:00,054 --> 03:17:02,910
Let justice be done upon him!

1617
03:17:46,346 --> 03:17:50,357
My master, Sauron the Great, bids thee welcome.

1618
03:17:56,198 --> 03:17:59,909
Is there any in this rout with
authority to treat with me?

1619
03:18:00,265 --> 03:18:03,416
We do not come to treat with Sauron...

1620
03:18:03,549 --> 03:18:06,103
faithless and accursed.

1621
03:18:06,113 --> 03:18:10,117
Tell your master this: The
armies of Mordor must disband.

1622
03:18:10,221 --> 03:18:13,037
He is to depart these lands, never to return.

1623
03:18:13,975 --> 03:18:16,555
Old Greybeard.

1624
03:18:17,885 --> 03:18:22,272
I have a token I was bidden to show thee.

1625
03:18:27,279 --> 03:18:28,607
Frodo.

1626
03:18:31,449 --> 03:18:32,908
Frodo.

1627
03:18:33,629 --> 03:18:35,107
- Silence.
- No!

1628
03:18:35,713 --> 03:18:37,281
Silence!

1629
03:18:39,050 --> 03:18:42,829
The Halfling was dear to thee, I see.

1630
03:18:43,742 --> 03:18:47,916
Know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host.

1631
03:18:53,281 --> 03:18:59,181
Who would've thought one so
small could endure so much pain?

1632
03:19:01,779 --> 03:19:03,932
And he did, Gandalf.

1633
03:19:04,072 --> 03:19:05,847
He did.

1634
03:19:12,779 --> 03:19:14,356
And who is this?

1635
03:19:14,447 --> 03:19:16,606
Isildur's heir?

1636
03:19:16,741 --> 03:19:19,782
It takes more to make a king
than a broken Elvish blade.

1637
03:19:24,508 --> 03:19:27,112
I guess that concludes negotiations.

1638
03:19:29,252 --> 03:19:30,450
I do not believe it.

1639
03:19:32,432 --> 03:19:33,838
I will not.

1640
03:19:45,000 --> 03:19:47,000
[Black Speech] <i> Ash nazg durb! </i>
[English]  One Ring to rule!

1641
03:19:49,895 --> 03:19:51,728
Pull back.

1642
03:19:51,980 --> 03:19:54,062
Pull back!

1643
03:19:56,200 --> 03:19:58,200
[Black Speech] <i> Ash nazg durb! </i>
[English]  One Ring to rule!

1644
03:20:06,264 --> 03:20:08,325
It's gone, Mr. Frodo.

1645
03:20:10,226 --> 03:20:13,772
The light's passed on, away towards the north.

1646
03:20:13,876 --> 03:20:15,792
Something's drawn its gaze.

1647
03:20:30,324 --> 03:20:32,324
[Black Speech] <i> Ash nazg durb! </i>
[English]  One Ring to rule!

1648
03:20:33,268 --> 03:20:36,061
Hold your ground! Hold your ground.

1649
03:20:37,908 --> 03:20:42,145
Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!

1650
03:20:44,946 --> 03:20:46,903
I see in your eyes...

1651
03:20:47,240 --> 03:20:51,325
the same fear that would take the heart of me.

1652
03:20:53,286 --> 03:20:57,040
A day may come when the courage of Men fails...

1653
03:20:57,061 --> 03:21:00,659
when we forsake our friends and
break all bonds of fellowship.

1654
03:21:00,689 --> 03:21:03,504
But it is not this day.

1655
03:21:03,764 --> 03:21:06,832
An hour of wolves and shattered shields...

1656
03:21:06,997 --> 03:21:09,878
when the age of Men comes crashing down.

1657
03:21:10,020 --> 03:21:12,507
But it is not this day.

1658
03:21:12,679 --> 03:21:14,339
This day we fight!

1659
03:21:16,433 --> 03:21:20,472
By all that you hold dear on this good earth...

1660
03:21:20,644 --> 03:21:24,891
I bid you stand, Men of the West!

1661
03:22:53,344 --> 03:22:56,889
Never thought I'd die fighting
side by side with an Elf.

1662
03:22:57,358 --> 03:22:59,683
What about side by side with a friend?

1663
03:23:03,196 --> 03:23:04,981
Aye.

1664
03:23:05,803 --> 03:23:07,615
I could do that.

1665
03:23:37,915 --> 03:23:40,012
Do you remember the Shire, Mr. Frodo?

1666
03:23:42,972 --> 03:23:45,225
It'll be spring soon.

1667
03:23:45,995 --> 03:23:48,731
And the orchards will be in blossom.

1668
03:23:48,863 --> 03:23:52,569
And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket.

1669
03:23:53,920 --> 03:23:57,949
And they'll be sowing the summer
barley in the lower fields...

1670
03:23:58,977 --> 03:24:03,374
and eating the first of the strawberries with cream.

1671
03:24:05,284 --> 03:24:07,785
Do you remember the taste of strawberries?

1672
03:24:09,350 --> 03:24:11,090
No, Sam.

1673
03:24:11,227 --> 03:24:14,212
I can't recall the taste of food...

1674
03:24:15,345 --> 03:24:18,630
nor the sound of water...

1675
03:24:18,786 --> 03:24:22,389
nor the touch of grass.

1676
03:24:23,321 --> 03:24:24,895
I'm...

1677
03:24:25,772 --> 03:24:27,147
naked in the dark.

1678
03:24:28,795 --> 03:24:31,104
There's... there's nothing.

1679
03:24:31,245 --> 03:24:35,985
No veil between me and the wheel of fire.

1680
03:24:37,240 --> 03:24:39,149
I can see him...

1681
03:24:39,534 --> 03:24:41,236
with my waking eyes.

1682
03:24:42,245 --> 03:24:44,741
Then let us be rid of it...

1683
03:24:45,320 --> 03:24:47,572
once and for all.

1684
03:24:48,292 --> 03:24:50,368
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1685
03:24:50,533 --> 03:24:53,165
I can't carry it for you...

1686
03:24:53,557 --> 03:24:55,628
but I can carry you.

1687
03:24:56,164 --> 03:24:57,918
Come on!

1688
03:25:28,329 --> 03:25:31,282
Aragorn.

1689
03:25:42,821 --> 03:25:46,574
Elessar.

1690
03:25:57,418 --> 03:25:59,845
For Frodo.

1691
03:26:34,795 --> 03:26:36,300
Look, Mr. Frodo.

1692
03:26:36,985 --> 03:26:39,222
A doorway.

1693
03:26:39,800 --> 03:26:41,470
We're almost there.

1694
03:26:43,813 --> 03:26:47,763
Clever Hobbits to climb so high!

1695
03:27:01,694 --> 03:27:03,365
Mustn't go that way.

1696
03:27:04,874 --> 03:27:07,372
Mustn't hurt the precious.

1697
03:27:07,533 --> 03:27:09,287
You swore!

1698
03:27:09,462 --> 03:27:11,538
You swore on the precious!

1699
03:27:13,423 --> 03:27:15,381
Smeagol promised!

1700
03:27:16,291 --> 03:27:18,294
Smeagol lied.

1701
03:28:10,768 --> 03:28:12,683
Frodo!

1702
03:28:39,753 --> 03:28:41,538
Eagles.

1703
03:28:42,932 --> 03:28:44,457
The eagles are coming!

1704
03:29:07,278 --> 03:29:09,151
Frodo!

1705
03:29:14,367 --> 03:29:15,689
I'm here, Sam.

1706
03:29:23,126 --> 03:29:24,792
Destroy it!

1707
03:29:35,324 --> 03:29:38,630
Go on! Now!

1708
03:29:38,765 --> 03:29:41,343
Throw it in the fire!

1709
03:29:54,717 --> 03:29:57,406
What are you waiting for?

1710
03:29:59,252 --> 03:30:01,655
Just let it go!

1711
03:30:34,857 --> 03:30:37,099
The Ring is mine.

1712
03:30:40,643 --> 03:30:42,397
No.

1713
03:30:42,781 --> 03:30:44,103
No.

1714
03:30:52,530 --> 03:30:55,209
No!

1715
03:32:39,606 --> 03:32:41,511
Yes!

1716
03:32:42,682 --> 03:32:44,389
Yes!

1717
03:32:45,497 --> 03:32:48,388
Precious! Precious!

1718
03:32:48,521 --> 03:32:51,729
Precious! Precious!

1719
03:33:44,613 --> 03:33:46,482
Give me your hand!

1720
03:33:54,830 --> 03:33:57,238
Take my hand!

1721
03:33:59,887 --> 03:34:01,247
No!

1722
03:34:08,489 --> 03:34:10,466
Don't you let go.

1723
03:34:15,057 --> 03:34:16,635
Don't let go.

1724
03:34:18,238 --> 03:34:19,728
Reach!

1725
03:35:48,893 --> 03:35:51,763
Frodo!

1726
03:35:52,333 --> 03:35:55,355
Frodo!

1727
03:37:16,681 --> 03:37:18,550
It's gone.

1728
03:37:22,988 --> 03:37:24,763
It's done.

1729
03:37:25,230 --> 03:37:27,265
Yes, Mr. Frodo.

1730
03:37:28,619 --> 03:37:31,058
It's over now.

1731
03:37:56,717 --> 03:37:59,089
I can see the Shire.

1732
03:38:01,305 --> 03:38:03,630
The Brandywine River.

1733
03:38:05,736 --> 03:38:07,759
Bag End.

1734
03:38:10,063 --> 03:38:12,809
Gandalf's fireworks.

1735
03:38:13,191 --> 03:38:16,981
The lights in the Party Tree.

1736
03:38:18,456 --> 03:38:21,606
Rosie Cotton dancing.

1737
03:38:22,730 --> 03:38:25,445
She had ribbons in her hair.

1738
03:38:28,361 --> 03:38:31,325
If ever I was to marry someone...

1739
03:38:32,219 --> 03:38:34,492
it would've been her.

1740
03:38:35,919 --> 03:38:37,995
It would've been her.

1741
03:38:50,099 --> 03:38:53,349
I'm glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee...

1742
03:38:57,606 --> 03:39:00,565
here at the end of all things.

1743
03:40:50,208 --> 03:40:52,289
Gandalf?

1744
03:41:11,895 --> 03:41:13,929
Frodo!

1745
03:41:33,685 --> 03:41:35,533
Gimli!

1746
03:43:18,468 --> 03:43:22,258
Now come the days of the king.

1747
03:43:27,227 --> 03:43:29,593
May they be blessed.

1748
03:43:49,851 --> 03:43:52,541
This day does not belong to one man...

1749
03:43:52,666 --> 03:43:54,582
but to all.

1750
03:43:56,211 --> 03:43:59,170
Let us together rebuild this world...

1751
03:43:59,339 --> 03:44:03,585
that we may share in the days of peace.

My friends...

1762
03:46:45,427 --> 03:46:48,117
you bow to no one.

1763
03:47:32,241 --> 03:47:34,405
And thus it was.

1764
03:47:34,535 --> 03:47:38,194
A Fourth Age of Middle-earth began.

1765
03:47:38,340 --> 03:47:40,910
And the Fellowship of the Ring...

1766
03:47:41,051 --> 03:47:45,578
though eternally bound by friendship and love...

1767
03:47:45,742 --> 03:47:48,160
was ended.

1768
03:47:53,146 --> 03:47:57,969
Thirteen months to the day since
Gandalf sent us on our long journey...

1769
03:47:58,097 --> 03:48:02,350
we found ourselves looking upon a familiar sight.

1770
03:48:04,875 --> 03:48:07,600
We were home.

1771
03:48:14,154 --> 03:48:16,027
Hi.

1772
03:48:33,182 --> 03:48:35,419
Hey, watch the pumpkin.

1773
03:49:23,488 --> 03:49:25,087
More of the same, Rosie.

1774
03:49:25,261 --> 03:49:27,252
Good night, lads.

1775
03:50:24,794 --> 03:50:28,812
How do you pick up the threads of an old life?

1776
03:50:30,111 --> 03:50:32,359
How do you go on...

1777
03:50:32,509 --> 03:50:37,737
when in your heart you begin to understand...

1778
03:50:38,974 --> 03:50:41,947
there is no going back?

1779
03:50:42,622 --> 03:50:46,329
There are some things that time cannot mend...

1780
03:50:46,793 --> 03:50:49,752
some hurts that go too deep...

1781
03:50:51,485 --> 03:50:54,341
that have taken hold.

1782
03:51:32,459 --> 03:51:34,375
Mr. Frodo?

1783
03:51:37,673 --> 03:51:39,090
What is it?

1784
03:51:40,904 --> 03:51:44,875
It's been four years to the day since Weathertop, Sam.

1785
03:51:45,544 --> 03:51:48,259
It's never really healed.

1786
03:51:52,217 --> 03:51:57,482
"There and Back Again." A
Hobbit's tale by Bilbo Baggins.

1787
03:51:58,160 --> 03:52:02,018
And "The Lord of the Rings" by Frodo Baggins.

1788
03:52:02,487 --> 03:52:04,687
You finished it.

1789
03:52:07,544 --> 03:52:09,069
Not quite.

1790
03:52:09,838 --> 03:52:12,448
There's room for a little more.

1791
03:52:15,050 --> 03:52:19,293
Bilbo once told me his part in this tale would end...

1792
03:52:19,429 --> 03:52:22,746
that each of us must come and go in the telling.

1793
03:52:23,600 --> 03:52:26,465
Bilbo's story was now over.

1794
03:52:26,936 --> 03:52:29,884
There would be no more journeys for him...

1795
03:52:30,012 --> 03:52:31,595
save one.

1796
03:52:32,306 --> 03:52:35,955
Tell me again, lad, where are we going?

1797
03:52:36,059 --> 03:52:38,093
To the harbor, Bilbo.

1798
03:52:38,249 --> 03:52:40,973
The Elves have accorded you a special honor...

1799
03:52:41,115 --> 03:52:43,768
a place on the last ship to leave Middle-earth.

1800
03:52:45,442 --> 03:52:47,144
Frodo...

1801
03:52:48,570 --> 03:52:53,113
any chance of seeing that old Ring of mine again?

1802
03:52:53,732 --> 03:52:55,983
The one I gave you.

1803
03:52:59,622 --> 03:53:01,780
I'm sorry, Uncle.

1804
03:53:04,314 --> 03:53:06,956
I'm afraid I lost it.

1805
03:53:07,129 --> 03:53:08,921
Oh.

1806
03:53:09,474 --> 03:53:11,006
Pity.

1807
03:53:13,749 --> 03:53:17,627
I should like to have held it one last time.

1808
03:53:46,748 --> 03:53:51,831
Well, here's a sight I have never seen before.

1809
03:54:05,985 --> 03:54:09,349
The power of the Three Rings is ended.

1810
03:54:10,102 --> 03:54:12,931
The time has come...

1811
03:54:13,074 --> 03:54:16,359
for the dominion of Men.

1812
03:54:16,800 --> 03:54:19,800
[Sindarin] <i>I Aear cân ven na mar.</i>
[English] The sea calls us to home.

1813
03:54:28,765 --> 03:54:30,945
I think I'm...

1814
03:54:31,112 --> 03:54:35,499
quite ready for another adventure.

1815
03:55:06,561 --> 03:55:08,859
Farewell...

1816
03:55:09,010 --> 03:55:11,783
my brave Hobbits.

1817
03:55:13,702 --> 03:55:15,736
My work is now finished.

1818
03:55:19,541 --> 03:55:24,541
Here at last, on the shores of the sea...

1819
03:55:25,171 --> 03:55:28,048
comes the end of our Fellowship.

1820
03:55:31,583 --> 03:55:34,085
I will not say, "Do not weep"...

1821
03:55:34,763 --> 03:55:38,760
for not all tears are an evil.

1822
03:55:56,293 --> 03:55:58,233
It is time, Frodo.

1823
03:56:03,748 --> 03:56:05,782
What does he mean?

1824
03:56:08,231 --> 03:56:11,122
We set out to save the Shire, Sam.

1825
03:56:12,714 --> 03:56:15,466
And it has been saved.

1826
03:56:19,127 --> 03:56:21,806
But not for me.

1827
03:56:22,723 --> 03:56:25,179
You don't mean that.

1828
03:56:26,372 --> 03:56:28,469
You can't leave.

1829
03:56:36,903 --> 03:56:39,649
The last pages are for you, Sam.

1830
04:00:12,724 --> 04:00:15,595
My dear Sam

1831
04:00:17,521 --> 04:00:20,853
You cannot always be torn in two.

1832
04:00:21,013 --> 04:00:25,151
You will have to be one and whole for many years.

1833
04:00:25,757 --> 04:00:31,359
You have so much to enjoy and to be and to do.

1834
04:00:32,482 --> 04:00:35,783
Your part in the story will go on.

1835
04:00:36,496 --> 04:00:38,281
Well...

1836
04:00:40,145 --> 04:00:41,874
I'm back.

1837
04:06:39,460 --> 04:06:44,915
...into the west.
