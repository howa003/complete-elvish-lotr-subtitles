These English & Foreign subtitles created by ZoowlCZ (ver. 2024-10) are an expanded version of the English subtitles created by Bokutox of YIFY-TORRENTS (Torporr of Outland PVP (EU)).

2
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:16,419
You may go no further.

3
00:00:19,855 --> 00:00:22,356
You will not enter Gondor.

4
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,399
Who are you to deny us passage?

5
00:00:25,482 --> 00:00:29,441
Legolas, fire a warning shot past the bosun's ear.

6
00:00:31,212 --> 00:00:32,775
Mind your aim.

7
00:00:39,503 --> 00:00:42,046
That's it. Right. We warned you.

8
00:00:42,254 --> 00:00:44,234
Prepare to be boarded.

9
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:47,140
Boarded?

10
00:00:47,151 --> 00:00:49,131
By you and whose army?

11
00:00:50,588 --> 00:00:52,359
This army.

12
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:11,007
In there.

13
00:01:13,091 --> 00:01:14,810
What is this place?

14
00:01:19,341 --> 00:01:22,623
Master must go inside the tunnel.

15
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,780
Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.

16
00:01:30,436 --> 00:01:32,156
It's the only way.

17
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,530
Go in...

18
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,214
or go back.

19
00:01:42,052 --> 00:01:44,671
I can't go back.

20
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,012
- What's that smell?
- Orcses' filth.

21
00:02:00,023 --> 00:02:02,968
Orcses come in here sometimes.

22
00:02:08,565 --> 00:02:09,815
Hurry.

23
00:02:15,076 --> 00:02:16,639
This way.

24
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:21,274
Smeagol?

25
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,400
Over here.

26
00:02:33,515 --> 00:02:35,859
It's sticky. What is it?

27
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:38,359
You will see.

28
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:40,808
Oh, yes.

29
00:02:41,277 --> 00:02:44,139
You will see.

30
00:02:53,413 --> 00:02:54,976
Smeagol?

31
00:02:56,747 --> 00:02:57,772
Smeagol!

32
00:03:00,393 --> 00:03:02,061
Smeagol!

33
00:03:11,644 --> 00:03:13,100
Sam.

34
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:55,791
And you, Frodo Baggins...

35
00:04:55,801 --> 00:05:00,733
I give you the light of
Earendil, our most beloved star.

36
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,188
May it be a light for you in dark places...

37
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:08,316
when all other lights go out.

38
00:05:08,749 --> 00:05:12,291
[Quenya] <i>Aiya Eärendil, Elenion Ancalima!</i>
[English] Hail Eärendil, Brightest of the Stars!

39
00:06:25,258 --> 00:06:28,073
Naughty little fly.

40
00:06:28,696 --> 00:06:32,029
Why does he cry?

41
00:06:32,446 --> 00:06:35,623
Caught in a web

42
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,248
Soon you'll be...

43
00:06:38,624 --> 00:06:40,450
Eaten.

44
00:07:18,545 --> 00:07:20,461
Got away, did it, precious?

45
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:22,659
Not this time.

46
00:07:22,868 --> 00:07:25,835
- Not this time!
- No!

47
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:36,002
It wasn't us. It wasn't us!

48
00:07:36,932 --> 00:07:39,485
Smeagol wouldn't hurt master.

49
00:07:39,641 --> 00:07:41,162
We promised.

50
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,067
You must believe us.

51
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,712
It was the precious.

52
00:07:46,516 --> 00:07:50,669
The precious made us do it.

53
00:08:08,081 --> 00:08:10,674
I have to destroy it, Smeagol.

54
00:08:20,113 --> 00:08:23,007
I have to destroy it for both our sakes.

55
00:08:33,448 --> 00:08:34,504
No!

56
00:08:58,034 --> 00:09:00,127
I'm so sorry, Sam.

57
00:09:05,014 --> 00:09:07,168
I'm so sorry.

58
00:09:33,454 --> 00:09:37,715
This task was appointed to you, Frodo of the Shire.

59
00:09:39,236 --> 00:09:41,372
If you do not find a way...

60
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,497
no one will.

61
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:20,312
The scouts report Minas Tirith is surrounded.

62
00:10:20,802 --> 00:10:22,767
The lower level's in flames.

63
00:10:23,511 --> 00:10:25,683
Everywhere, legions of the enemy advance.

64
00:10:26,481 --> 00:10:27,678
Time is against us.

65
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,974
Make ready!

66
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:30,972
Take heart, Merry.

67
00:10:31,325 --> 00:10:33,356
It will soon be over.

68
00:10:34,418 --> 00:10:35,648
My lady...

69
00:10:36,398 --> 00:10:38,774
you are fair and brave...

70
00:10:39,294 --> 00:10:41,535
and have much to live for...

71
00:10:43,148 --> 00:10:45,179
and many who love you.

72
00:10:48,358 --> 00:10:50,690
I know it is too late to turn aside.

73
00:10:51,848 --> 00:10:54,433
I know there is not much point now in hoping.

74
00:10:55,807 --> 00:10:59,400
If I were a knight of Rohan, capable of great deeds...

75
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:02,351
But
- I'm not.

76
00:11:02,786 --> 00:11:04,359
I'm a Hobbit.

77
00:11:07,506 --> 00:11:09,569
And I know I can't save Middle-earth.

78
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,266
I just want to help my friends.

79
00:11:17,683 --> 00:11:18,853
Frodo.

80
00:11:20,184 --> 00:11:21,442
Sam.

81
00:11:23,518 --> 00:11:25,066
Pippin.

82
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:30,080
More than anything, I wish I could see them again.

83
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:36,103
Prepare to move out!

84
00:11:36,477 --> 00:11:39,718
Make haste. We ride through the night.

85
00:11:56,124 --> 00:11:57,115
To battle.

86
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,094
To battle.

87
00:12:22,378 --> 00:12:23,741
Back to the gate!

88
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:26,190
Hurry!

89
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:50,570
I am steward of the House of Anarion.

90
00:12:51,027 --> 00:12:53,214
Thus have I walked.

91
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:57,590
And thus now will I sleep.

92
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:05,576
Gondor is lost.

93
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:09,487
There is no hope for Men.

94
00:13:24,624 --> 00:13:26,914
Why do the fools fly?

95
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:31,539
Better to die sooner than late.

96
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:35,741
For die we must.

97
00:13:48,377 --> 00:13:51,710
No tomb for Denethor and Faramir.

98
00:13:52,543 --> 00:13:58,065
No long, slow sleep of death embalmed.

99
00:13:58,741 --> 00:14:03,366
We shall burn, like the heathen kings of old.

100
00:14:07,493 --> 00:14:08,870
Bring wood and oil.

101
00:14:12,128 --> 00:14:13,038
Steady.

102
00:14:13,743 --> 00:14:15,250
Steady.

103
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:32,391
You are soldiers of Gondor.

104
00:14:32,912 --> 00:14:37,235
No matter what comes through that
gate, you will stand your ground.

105
00:14:43,506 --> 00:14:44,506
Run!

106
00:14:46,923 --> 00:14:48,226
Volley!

107
00:14:49,132 --> 00:14:50,546
Fire!

108
00:16:44,123 --> 00:16:45,842
Let him go, you filth.

109
00:16:47,894 --> 00:16:49,280
Let him go!

110
00:16:50,895 --> 00:16:52,977
You will not touch him again.

111
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,718
Come on and finish it.

112
00:18:47,781 --> 00:18:48,905
Back!

113
00:19:00,127 --> 00:19:01,273
Mr. Frodo.

114
00:19:11,065 --> 00:19:12,524
Oh, no.

115
00:19:13,149 --> 00:19:14,656
Frodo.

116
00:19:15,284 --> 00:19:16,823
Mr. Frodo.

117
00:19:21,764 --> 00:19:22,889
Wake up.

118
00:19:27,004 --> 00:19:29,140
Don't leave me here alone.

119
00:19:30,964 --> 00:19:33,099
Don't go where I can't follow.

120
00:19:37,526 --> 00:19:38,672
Wake up.

121
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,527
Not asleep.

122
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,590
Dead.

123
00:20:10,499 --> 00:20:12,373
You get back, you scum!

124
00:20:21,801 --> 00:20:23,364
What's this?

125
00:20:24,219 --> 00:20:27,114
Looks like old Shelob's been having a bit of fun.

126
00:20:28,938 --> 00:20:31,282
Killed another one, has she?

127
00:20:31,595 --> 00:20:33,418
No.

128
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:38,433
This fellow ain't dead.

129
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:40,605
Not dead?

130
00:20:41,126 --> 00:20:46,543
- She jabs him with her stinger,
and he goes as limp as a boned fish.

131
00:20:47,221 --> 00:20:49,825
Then she has her way with them.

132
00:20:50,397 --> 00:20:52,430
That's how she likes to feed.

133
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:54,513
Fresh blood.

134
00:20:54,722 --> 00:20:56,909
Get him to the tower!

135
00:21:00,608 --> 00:21:02,358
Samwise, you fool.

136
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,243
This scum will be awake in a couple of hours.

137
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,795
Then he'll wish he'd never been born.

138
00:21:32,277 --> 00:21:35,298
The house of his spirit crumbles.

139
00:21:36,653 --> 00:21:37,903
He is burning.

140
00:21:39,205 --> 00:21:40,560
Already burning.

141
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,487
He's not dead.

142
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:44,831
He's not dead!

143
00:21:46,915 --> 00:21:48,589
No! No!

144
00:21:49,102 --> 00:21:51,081
No! No!

145
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,529
He's not dead!

146
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:57,332
- Farewell, Peregrin, son of Paladin.
- No! No! No!

147
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,667
I release you from my service.

148
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:06,343
Go now and die in what way seems best to you.

149
00:22:08,698 --> 00:22:10,750
Pour oil on the wood!

150
00:22:12,646 --> 00:22:14,507
Come on, soldier! Move it!

151
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,926
- Hurry along there! Hurry along!
- Gandalf!

152
00:22:18,584 --> 00:22:19,834
Where is Gandalf?

153
00:22:21,293 --> 00:22:22,334
Gandalf!

154
00:22:28,116 --> 00:22:29,158
Retreat!

155
00:22:31,347 --> 00:22:33,064
The city is breached!

156
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:36,138
Fall back! To the second level!

157
00:22:39,993 --> 00:22:41,763
Get the women and children out!

158
00:22:41,868 --> 00:22:43,535
Get them out!

159
00:22:43,806 --> 00:22:45,150
Retreat!

160
00:22:45,253 --> 00:22:47,234
Come on. Come on, move.

161
00:22:47,442 --> 00:22:51,764
Move into the city. Kill all in your path.

162
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:02,079
Take them down!

163
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:25,675
Fight! Fight to the last man!

164
00:23:25,831 --> 00:23:27,341
Fight for your lives!

165
00:23:27,751 --> 00:23:28,683
Gandalf!

166
00:23:32,935 --> 00:23:34,112
Gandalf!

167
00:23:34,217 --> 00:23:36,874
Denethor has lost his mind!

168
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,270
He's burning Faramir alive!

169
00:23:39,311 --> 00:23:41,249
Up! Quickly!

170
00:23:48,332 --> 00:23:49,531
Go back to the abyss.

171
00:23:51,354 --> 00:23:54,687
Fall into the nothingness that
awaits you and your master.

172
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:01,356
Do you not know death when you see it, old man?

173
00:24:01,563 --> 00:24:05,596
This is my hour.

174
00:24:15,836 --> 00:24:16,824
Gandalf!

175
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:29,275
You have failed.

176
00:24:30,338 --> 00:24:35,213
The world of Men will fall.

177
00:25:32,353 --> 00:25:33,446
Courage, Merry.

178
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,104
Courage for our friends.

179
00:25:39,928 --> 00:25:43,054
Form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks!

180
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:46,261
Pikes in front. Archers behind.

181
00:25:54,491 --> 00:25:57,669
Eomer, take your Eored down the left flank.

182
00:25:57,909 --> 00:25:58,972
Flank ready.

183
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,888
Gamling, follow the king's banner down the center.

184
00:26:02,044 --> 00:26:05,847
Grimbold, take your company
right after you pass the wall.

185
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,556
Forth, and fear no darkness!

186
00:26:08,973 --> 00:26:12,619
Arise, arise, Riders of Theoden!

187
00:26:12,994 --> 00:26:18,139
Spears shall be shaken...
Shields shall be splintered...

188
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:21,942
a sword-day, a red day...

189
00:26:22,265 --> 00:26:25,616
and the sun rises!

190
00:26:33,662 --> 00:26:38,142
Whatever happens, stay with me. I'll look after you.

191
00:26:44,341 --> 00:26:46,372
Ride now!

192
00:26:47,882 --> 00:26:49,743
Ride now!

193
00:26:50,591 --> 00:26:53,404
Ride! Ride for ruin...

194
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:56,790
and the world's ending!

195
00:26:58,196 --> 00:27:02,103
- Death!
- Death!

196
00:27:03,196 --> 00:27:06,269
- Death!
- Death!

197
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:08,874
- Death!
- Death!

198
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:13,563
- Death!
- Death!

199
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:20,177
For Eorlingas!

200
00:28:03,254 --> 00:28:04,557
Fire!

201
00:28:08,776 --> 00:28:10,599
Death!

202
00:28:14,141 --> 00:28:15,860
Charge!

203
00:28:15,912 --> 00:28:16,998
Fire at will!

204
00:29:14,928 --> 00:29:17,793
Set a fire in our flesh.

205
00:29:35,681 --> 00:29:37,327
Stay this madness!

206
00:29:41,745 --> 00:29:46,077
You may triumph in the field of battle for a day...

207
00:29:46,713 --> 00:29:50,245
but against the power that has risen in the east...

208
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:53,474
there is no victory.

209
00:30:23,008 --> 00:30:24,676
No!

210
00:30:24,738 --> 00:30:27,592
You will not take my son from me!

211
00:30:27,623 --> 00:30:29,728
No!

212
00:30:40,928 --> 00:30:42,333
Faramir.

213
00:30:56,138 --> 00:30:59,835
So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.

214
00:31:27,754 --> 00:31:29,838
Drive them to the river!

215
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:34,475
Make safe the city!

216
00:32:14,217 --> 00:32:15,936
Re-form the line!

217
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:19,010
Re-form the line!

218
00:32:26,198 --> 00:32:28,959
Sound the charge! Take them head-on!

219
00:32:29,427 --> 00:32:31,615
Charge!

220
00:33:50,374 --> 00:33:51,624
Cut him down!

221
00:34:18,606 --> 00:34:21,054
Take the reins. Pull him left!

222
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:24,543
Left!

223
00:34:42,306 --> 00:34:43,765
Aim for their heads!

224
00:34:49,807 --> 00:34:53,141
Bring it down! Bring it down! Bring it down!

225
00:34:58,817 --> 00:34:59,756
Merry!

226
00:35:06,996 --> 00:35:08,402
Merry!

227
00:36:21,795 --> 00:36:23,722
I didn't think it would end this way.

228
00:36:25,077 --> 00:36:26,534
End?

229
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:30,130
No, the journey doesn't end here.

230
00:36:32,411 --> 00:36:35,338
Death is just another path...

231
00:36:36,204 --> 00:36:38,203
one that we all must take.

232
00:36:39,171 --> 00:36:42,734
The grey rain curtain of this world rolls back...

233
00:36:42,838 --> 00:36:46,276
and all turns to silver glass.

234
00:36:48,569 --> 00:36:50,340
And then you see it.

235
00:36:52,256 --> 00:36:54,767
What, Gandalf?

236
00:36:55,934 --> 00:36:57,372
See what?

237
00:36:58,492 --> 00:37:00,497
White shores...

238
00:37:02,372 --> 00:37:04,613
and beyond.

239
00:37:06,175 --> 00:37:08,049
A far green country...

240
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,539
under a swift sunrise.

241
00:37:15,707 --> 00:37:17,426
Well...

242
00:37:17,478 --> 00:37:19,041
that isn't so bad.

243
00:37:19,062 --> 00:37:20,343
No.

244
00:37:22,686 --> 00:37:24,301
No, it isn't.

245
00:37:40,605 --> 00:37:43,991
Rally to me! To me!

246
00:38:04,931 --> 00:38:09,305
Feast on his flesh.

247
00:38:13,734 --> 00:38:15,869
I will kill you if you touch him.

248
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:21,391
Do not come between the Nazgul and his prey.

249
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:33,690
Late as usual, pirate scum!

250
00:39:33,924 --> 00:39:35,720
There's knife-work here needs doing.

251
00:39:35,772 --> 00:39:39,588
Come on, you sea rats! Get off your ships!

252
00:39:54,707 --> 00:39:57,081
There's plenty for the both of us.

253
00:39:57,181 --> 00:39:59,525
May the best Dwarf win.

254
00:40:16,871 --> 00:40:19,095
You fool.

255
00:40:19,266 --> 00:40:22,680
No man can kill me.

256
00:40:25,049 --> 00:40:28,223
Die now.

257
00:40:38,852 --> 00:40:40,885
I am no man.

258
00:40:57,396 --> 00:41:00,893
- 15! 16!
- 17!

259
00:41:08,688 --> 00:41:10,597
Merry!

260
00:41:52,568 --> 00:41:54,358
Legolas!

261
00:42:16,738 --> 00:42:19,107
33, 34.

262
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:08,529
That still only counts as one!

263
00:43:08,659 --> 00:43:10,858
Come on, then. Come on!

264
00:43:54,539 --> 00:43:57,372
I know your face...

265
00:43:59,154 --> 00:44:01,074
Eowyn.

266
00:44:03,665 --> 00:44:06,035
My eyes darken.

267
00:44:07,124 --> 00:44:08,561
No.

268
00:44:09,374 --> 00:44:11,062
No.

269
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,572
I am going to save you.

270
00:44:16,895 --> 00:44:19,239
You already did.

271
00:44:22,917 --> 00:44:24,540
Eowyn...

272
00:44:25,991 --> 00:44:28,532
my body is broken.

273
00:44:33,538 --> 00:44:36,038
You have to let me go.

274
00:44:41,898 --> 00:44:44,491
I go to my fathers...

275
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:48,793
in whose mighty company...

276
00:44:49,211 --> 00:44:52,583
I shall not now feel ashamed.

277
00:45:09,141 --> 00:45:10,795
Eowyn.

278
00:45:57,219 --> 00:45:59,714
Release us.

279
00:46:01,568 --> 00:46:03,341
Bad idea.

280
00:46:03,495 --> 00:46:07,219
Very handy in a tight spot, these
lads, despite the fact they're dead.

281
00:46:07,245 --> 00:46:09,502
You gave us your word.

282
00:46:11,178 --> 00:46:13,366
I hold your oath fulfilled.

283
00:46:14,589 --> 00:46:16,047
Go.

284
00:46:16,751 --> 00:46:18,587
Be at peace.

285
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:03,787
Merry.

286
00:47:04,361 --> 00:47:07,694
No!

287
00:47:11,236 --> 00:47:13,996
No!

288
00:47:37,625 --> 00:47:41,552
With a sigh.

289
00:47:41,667 --> 00:47:45,426
You turn away.

290
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:49,594
With a deepening heart.

291
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:54,522
No more words to say.

292
00:47:54,647 --> 00:47:58,168
You will find.

293
00:47:58,219 --> 00:48:06,710
That the world has changed forever.

294
00:48:31,379 --> 00:48:39,183
And the trees are now turning from green to gold.

295
00:48:43,047 --> 00:48:47,860
And the sun is now fading.

296
00:48:47,965 --> 00:48:58,028
I wish I could hold you closer.

297
00:49:00,857 --> 00:49:02,133
Merry!

298
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:05,780
Merry!

299
00:49:17,113 --> 00:49:18,939
Merry.

300
00:49:21,406 --> 00:49:22,650
Merry, it's me.

301
00:49:25,261 --> 00:49:26,823
It's Pippin.

302
00:49:29,323 --> 00:49:31,610
I knew you'd find me.

303
00:49:31,782 --> 00:49:32,979
Yes.

304
00:49:35,408 --> 00:49:37,482
Are you going to leave me?

305
00:49:38,032 --> 00:49:39,739
No, Merry.

306
00:49:41,033 --> 00:49:43,272
I'm going to look after you.

307
00:50:26,933 --> 00:50:28,655
Hands off!

308
00:50:28,808 --> 00:50:31,993
That shiny shirt, that's mine.

309
00:50:32,246 --> 00:50:36,406
It's going to the Great Eye,
along with everything else.

310
00:50:37,924 --> 00:50:41,830
I don't take orders from stinking Morgul-rats!

311
00:50:42,611 --> 00:50:47,768
You touch it, and I'll stick this blade in your gut.

312
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,167
The scum tried to knife me.

313
00:51:10,219 --> 00:51:12,158
Kill him!

314
00:52:55,229 --> 00:52:57,293
That's for Frodo!

315
00:52:57,573 --> 00:52:59,798
And for the Shire!

316
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,508
And that's for my old Gaffer!

317
00:53:34,921 --> 00:53:38,304
Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.

318
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:44,137
I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.

319
00:53:51,382 --> 00:53:53,134
Not if I stick you first.

320
00:53:53,257 --> 00:53:54,819
Sam!

321
00:53:59,872 --> 00:54:01,955
Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.

322
00:54:02,007 --> 00:54:04,138
Sorry for everything.

323
00:54:04,351 --> 00:54:08,305
- Let's get you out of here.
- It's too late. It's over.

324
00:54:08,415 --> 00:54:11,345
They've taken it. Sam...

325
00:54:12,112 --> 00:54:13,637
they took the Ring.

326
00:54:14,352 --> 00:54:17,096
Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

327
00:54:29,041 --> 00:54:31,266
I thought I'd lost you.

328
00:54:31,646 --> 00:54:33,352
So I took it.

329
00:54:34,511 --> 00:54:36,595
Only for safekeeping.

330
00:54:37,845 --> 00:54:39,596
Give it to me.

331
00:54:43,105 --> 00:54:45,351
Give me the Ring, Sam.

332
00:54:49,981 --> 00:54:51,266
Sam.

333
00:54:52,846 --> 00:54:54,811
Give me the Ring.

334
00:55:15,505 --> 00:55:16,805
You must understand.

335
00:55:20,297 --> 00:55:22,143
The Ring is my burden.

336
00:55:23,317 --> 00:55:25,474
It will destroy you, Sam.

337
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:30,606
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

338
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:33,567
We best find you some clothes.

339
00:55:33,736 --> 00:55:36,769
You can't go walking through
Mordor in naught but your skin.

340
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:00,692
We did it, Mr. Frodo.

341
00:56:01,197 --> 00:56:03,483
We made it to Mordor.

342
00:56:04,822 --> 00:56:06,480
There are so many of them.

343
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:10,018
We'll never get through unseen.

344
00:56:15,145 --> 00:56:18,487
It's him, the Eye.

345
00:56:26,198 --> 00:56:28,818
We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.

346
00:56:29,283 --> 00:56:31,320
There's nothing for it.

347
00:56:34,325 --> 00:56:38,733
Come on. Let's just make it down the hill for starters.

348
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:51,324
Frodo has passed beyond my sight.

349
00:56:52,597 --> 00:56:55,462
The darkness is deepening.

350
00:56:55,514 --> 00:56:57,806
If Sauron had the Ring, we would know it.

351
00:56:57,817 --> 00:57:00,240
It's only a matter of time.

352
00:57:01,713 --> 00:57:04,150
He has suffered a defeat, yes but...

353
00:57:05,203 --> 00:57:09,682
behind the walls of Mordor, our enemy is regrouping.

354
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:11,610
Let him stay there.

355
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:14,495
Let him rot! Why should we care?

356
00:57:14,558 --> 00:57:19,892
Because 10,000 Orcs now stand
between Frodo and Mount Doom.

357
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:29,111
I've sent him to his death.

358
00:57:30,622 --> 00:57:31,943
No.

359
00:57:32,446 --> 00:57:34,862
There is still hope for Frodo.

360
00:57:35,207 --> 00:57:39,330
He needs time and safe passage
across the plains of Gorgoroth.

361
00:57:40,414 --> 00:57:42,985
- We can give him that.
- How?

362
00:57:43,332 --> 00:57:46,034
Draw out Sauron's armies.

363
00:57:46,197 --> 00:57:48,328
Empty his lands.

364
00:57:48,541 --> 00:57:51,621
Then we gather our full strength
and march on the Black Gate.

365
00:57:52,186 --> 00:57:55,247
We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms.

366
00:57:55,416 --> 00:57:56,992
Not for ourselves.

367
00:57:57,187 --> 00:58:02,790
But we can give Frodo his chance if
we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.

368
00:58:04,584 --> 00:58:08,364
Keep him blind to all else that moves.

369
00:58:09,115 --> 00:58:10,323
A diversion.

370
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:12,291
Certainty of death...

371
00:58:12,398 --> 00:58:15,209
small chance of success...

372
00:58:16,044 --> 00:58:17,661
what are we waiting for?

373
00:58:18,232 --> 00:58:20,657
Sauron will suspect a trap.

374
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,498
He will not take the bait.

375
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:27,491
Oh, I think he will.

376
00:59:01,778 --> 00:59:04,486
Long have you hunted me.

377
00:59:04,693 --> 00:59:06,673
Long have I eluded you.

378
00:59:08,288 --> 00:59:10,083
No more.

379
00:59:11,727 --> 00:59:14,205
Behold the Sword of Elendil.

380
00:59:58,658 --> 01:00:01,168
The city has fallen silent.

381
01:00:02,825 --> 01:00:05,879
There is no warmth left in the sun.

382
01:00:06,679 --> 01:00:08,386
It grows so cold.

383
01:00:11,367 --> 01:00:14,422
It's just the damp of the first spring rain.

384
01:00:20,796 --> 01:00:24,006
I do not believe this darkness will endure.

385
01:00:52,569 --> 01:00:54,184
Look, the Orcs...

386
01:00:54,653 --> 01:00:56,717
they're moving off.

387
01:00:57,768 --> 01:00:59,842
You see, Mr. Frodo...

388
01:01:00,019 --> 01:01:02,342
some luck at last.

389
01:01:02,519 --> 01:01:04,344
Move it, you slugs!

390
01:01:05,592 --> 01:01:09,010
Come on! Faster!

391
01:01:16,895 --> 01:01:20,124
Come along, you coldhearted wretched scum...

392
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:24,680
I'll whip you down to the bone, you...

393
01:01:27,522 --> 01:01:29,189
Come on!

394
01:01:29,355 --> 01:01:31,565
What have I told you?

395
01:01:31,585 --> 01:01:33,876
No evation...

396
01:01:34,865 --> 01:01:36,688
Now move it!

397
01:01:38,512 --> 01:01:40,015
Get up!

398
01:01:40,387 --> 01:01:43,064
Come on, you slugs!

399
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,846
You two are going straight to the front line!

400
01:01:47,024 --> 01:01:52,315
Now, move it! Go on! Fall
in! Move it! Move it! Move it!

401
01:02:04,869 --> 01:02:08,672
To the Gate, you slugs! Now, move it!

402
01:02:18,099 --> 01:02:21,689
Don't you know we're at war?

403
01:02:43,988 --> 01:02:46,855
Company, halt!

404
01:02:50,655 --> 01:02:54,062
Inspection!

405
01:02:54,197 --> 01:02:56,692
Sam, help me.

406
01:02:56,854 --> 01:02:58,689
Mr. Frodo!

407
01:03:01,385 --> 01:03:03,941
Stand up, Mr. Frodo. Stand up!

408
01:03:04,093 --> 01:03:05,939
It's so heavy.

409
01:03:15,033 --> 01:03:16,236
Oh, no.

410
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:23,857
What do I do? What do we do?

411
01:03:26,908 --> 01:03:28,070
- Hit me.
- What?

412
01:03:28,211 --> 01:03:30,280
Hit me, Sam. Start fighting.

413
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:32,026
Get off of me!

414
01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:35,024
Nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot.

415
01:03:43,629 --> 01:03:45,698
Get off of me!

416
01:03:46,597 --> 01:03:48,526
Break it up! Break it up!

417
01:03:51,078 --> 01:03:55,694
Oi! I'll have your guts if you
don't shut this rabble down!

418
01:03:55,714 --> 01:03:58,151
Go, Sam. Now!

419
01:04:07,069 --> 01:04:08,620
Move along, scum!

420
01:04:08,787 --> 01:04:10,695
Back in the line!

421
01:04:11,184 --> 01:04:12,995
You maggots!

422
01:04:13,633 --> 01:04:16,661
Get back into the line, you slugs!

423
01:04:18,997 --> 01:04:22,528
Dig it, you slugs. Move it.

424
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:13,332
I can't...

425
01:05:13,482 --> 01:05:17,247
I can't... I can't manage the Ring, Sam.

426
01:05:17,336 --> 01:05:18,575
It's... It's...

427
01:05:18,743 --> 01:05:21,324
It's such a weight to carry.

428
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:23,242
It's...

429
01:05:23,379 --> 01:05:25,376
Such a weight.

430
01:05:30,306 --> 01:05:32,807
We're going that way. Straight as we can.

431
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:37,391
There's no point carrying
anything we're not sure to need.

432
01:05:52,444 --> 01:05:54,373
Mr. Frodo.

433
01:05:55,830 --> 01:05:57,375
Look.

434
01:05:59,841 --> 01:06:01,790
There is light...

435
01:06:02,132 --> 01:06:03,695
and beauty up there...

436
01:06:03,955 --> 01:06:06,422
that no shadow can touch.

437
01:06:57,399 --> 01:06:59,053
Take mine.

438
01:06:59,533 --> 01:07:01,676
There's a few drops left.

439
01:07:16,827 --> 01:07:19,461
There will be none left for the return journey.

440
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:23,555
I don't think there will be
a return journey, Mr. Frodo.

441
01:07:58,046 --> 01:08:00,044
[Black Speech] <i> Kelkum-ishi. </i>
[English]  In the coldness.

442
01:08:16,364 --> 01:08:18,553
Frodo, get down!

443
01:08:20,271 --> 01:08:22,221
Hide!

444
01:08:32,356 --> 01:08:34,394
Frodo!

445
01:08:40,170 --> 01:08:41,642
Where are they?

446
01:09:17,673 --> 01:09:20,728
Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!

447
01:09:21,633 --> 01:09:24,486
Let justice be done upon him!

448
01:10:07,887 --> 01:10:11,895
My master, Sauron the Great, bids thee welcome.

449
01:10:17,731 --> 01:10:21,439
Is there any in this rout with
authority to treat with me?

450
01:10:21,795 --> 01:10:24,943
We do not come to treat with Sauron...

451
01:10:25,076 --> 01:10:27,628
faithless and accursed.

452
01:10:27,638 --> 01:10:31,639
Tell your master this: The
armies of Mordor must disband.

453
01:10:31,743 --> 01:10:34,557
He is to depart these lands, never to return.

454
01:10:35,494 --> 01:10:38,072
Old Greybeard.

455
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:43,784
I have a token I was bidden to show thee.

456
01:10:48,787 --> 01:10:50,114
Frodo.

457
01:10:52,954 --> 01:10:54,411
Frodo.

458
01:10:55,132 --> 01:10:56,609
- Silence.
- No!

459
01:10:57,214 --> 01:10:58,781
Silence!

460
01:11:00,549 --> 01:11:04,324
The Halfling was dear to thee, I see.

461
01:11:05,237 --> 01:11:09,407
Know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host.

462
01:11:14,768 --> 01:11:20,663
Who would've thought one so
small could endure so much pain?

463
01:11:23,259 --> 01:11:25,410
And he did, Gandalf.

464
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:27,324
He did.

465
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:35,826
And who is this?

466
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:38,074
Isildur's heir?

467
01:11:38,209 --> 01:11:41,248
It takes more to make a king
than a broken Elvish blade.

468
01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:48,572
I guess that concludes negotiations.

469
01:11:50,710 --> 01:11:51,907
I do not believe it.

470
01:11:53,887 --> 01:11:55,292
I will not.

471
01:12:06,445 --> 01:12:08,444
[Black Speech] <i> Ash nazg durb! </i>
[English]  One Ring to rule!

472
01:12:11,336 --> 01:12:13,168
Pull back.

473
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:15,500
Pull back!

474
01:12:17,636 --> 01:12:19,635
[Black Speech] <i> Ash nazg durb! </i>
[English]  One Ring to rule!

475
01:12:27,692 --> 01:12:29,751
It's gone, Mr. Frodo.

476
01:12:31,651 --> 01:12:35,194
The light's passed on, away towards the north.

477
01:12:35,298 --> 01:12:37,212
Something's drawn its gaze.

478
01:12:51,733 --> 01:12:53,731
[Black Speech] <i> Ash nazg durb! </i>
[English]  One Ring to rule!

479
01:12:54,674 --> 01:12:57,465
Hold your ground! Hold your ground.

480
01:12:59,311 --> 01:13:03,544
Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!

481
01:13:06,343 --> 01:13:08,298
I see in your eyes...

482
01:13:08,635 --> 01:13:12,717
the same fear that would take the heart of me.

483
01:13:14,676 --> 01:13:18,427
A day may come when the courage of Men fails...

484
01:13:18,448 --> 01:13:22,043
when we forsake our friends and
break all bonds of fellowship.

485
01:13:22,073 --> 01:13:24,886
But it is not this day.

486
01:13:25,146 --> 01:13:28,211
An hour of wolves and shattered shields...

487
01:13:28,376 --> 01:13:31,255
when the age of Men comes crashing down.

488
01:13:31,397 --> 01:13:33,882
But it is not this day.

489
01:13:34,053 --> 01:13:35,712
This day we fight!

490
01:13:37,804 --> 01:13:41,840
By all that you hold dear on this good earth...

491
01:13:42,012 --> 01:13:46,256
I bid you stand, Men of the West!

492
01:15:14,637 --> 01:15:18,179
Never thought I'd die fighting
side by side with an Elf.

493
01:15:18,648 --> 01:15:20,971
What about side by side with a friend?

494
01:15:24,481 --> 01:15:26,265
Aye.

495
01:15:27,086 --> 01:15:28,897
I could do that.

496
01:15:59,172 --> 01:16:01,267
Do you remember the Shire, Mr. Frodo?

497
01:16:04,225 --> 01:16:06,476
It'll be spring soon.

498
01:16:07,246 --> 01:16:09,979
And the orchards will be in blossom.

499
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:13,814
And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket.

500
01:16:15,164 --> 01:16:19,190
And they'll be sowing the summer
barley in the lower fields...

501
01:16:20,217 --> 01:16:24,611
and eating the first of the strawberries with cream.

502
01:16:26,519 --> 01:16:29,018
Do you remember the taste of strawberries?

503
01:16:30,582 --> 01:16:32,320
No, Sam.

504
01:16:32,457 --> 01:16:35,440
I can't recall the taste of food...

505
01:16:36,572 --> 01:16:39,854
nor the sound of water...

506
01:16:40,010 --> 01:16:43,610
nor the touch of grass.

507
01:16:44,541 --> 01:16:46,114
I'm...

508
01:16:46,990 --> 01:16:48,364
naked in the dark.

509
01:16:50,011 --> 01:16:52,318
There's... there's nothing.

510
01:16:52,459 --> 01:16:57,195
No veil between me and the wheel of fire.

511
01:16:58,449 --> 01:17:00,357
I can see him...

512
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:02,442
with my waking eyes.

513
01:17:03,450 --> 01:17:05,944
Then let us be rid of it...

514
01:17:06,523 --> 01:17:08,773
once and for all.

515
01:17:09,492 --> 01:17:11,567
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

516
01:17:11,731 --> 01:17:14,361
I can't carry it for you...

517
01:17:14,753 --> 01:17:16,822
but I can carry you.

518
01:17:17,358 --> 01:17:19,110
Come on!

519
01:17:49,497 --> 01:17:52,447
Aragorn.

520
01:18:03,977 --> 01:18:07,727
Elessar.

521
01:18:18,562 --> 01:18:20,987
For Frodo.

522
01:18:55,909 --> 01:18:57,413
Look, Mr. Frodo.

523
01:18:58,097 --> 01:19:00,333
A doorway.

524
01:19:00,910 --> 01:19:02,579
We're almost there.

525
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:08,867
Clever Hobbits to climb so high!

526
01:19:22,786 --> 01:19:24,456
Mustn't go that way.

527
01:19:25,964 --> 01:19:28,460
Mustn't hurt the precious.

528
01:19:28,621 --> 01:19:30,373
You swore!

529
01:19:30,548 --> 01:19:32,623
You swore on the precious!

530
01:19:34,506 --> 01:19:36,462
Smeagol promised!

531
01:19:37,372 --> 01:19:39,373
Smeagol lied.

532
01:20:31,805 --> 01:20:33,718
Frodo!

533
01:21:00,766 --> 01:21:02,550
Eagles.

534
01:21:03,943 --> 01:21:05,466
The eagles are coming!

535
01:21:28,269 --> 01:21:30,140
Frodo!

536
01:21:35,352 --> 01:21:36,673
I'm here, Sam.

537
01:21:44,104 --> 01:21:45,769
Destroy it!

538
01:21:56,292 --> 01:21:59,596
Go on! Now!

539
01:21:59,731 --> 01:22:02,306
Throw it in the fire!

540
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:18,357
What are you waiting for?

541
01:22:20,201 --> 01:22:22,602
Just let it go!

542
01:22:55,777 --> 01:22:58,017
The Ring is mine.

543
01:23:01,559 --> 01:23:03,311
No.

544
01:23:03,695 --> 01:23:05,016
No.

545
01:23:13,436 --> 01:23:16,113
No!

546
01:25:00,425 --> 01:25:02,329
Yes!

547
01:25:03,499 --> 01:25:05,205
Yes!

548
01:25:06,312 --> 01:25:09,200
Precious! Precious!

549
01:25:09,333 --> 01:25:12,539
Precious! Precious!

550
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:07,247
Give me your hand!

551
01:26:15,589 --> 01:26:17,995
Take my hand!

552
01:26:20,642 --> 01:26:22,001
No!

553
01:26:29,237 --> 01:26:31,212
Don't you let go.

554
01:26:35,799 --> 01:26:37,376
Don't let go.

555
01:26:38,978 --> 01:26:40,467
Reach!

556
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:12,427
Frodo!

557
01:28:12,997 --> 01:28:16,016
Frodo!

558
01:29:37,277 --> 01:29:39,144
It's gone.

559
01:29:43,579 --> 01:29:45,352
It's done.

560
01:29:45,819 --> 01:29:47,852
Yes, Mr. Frodo.

561
01:29:49,205 --> 01:29:51,642
It's over now.

562
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,650
I can see the Shire.

563
01:30:21,865 --> 01:30:24,188
The Brandywine River.

564
01:30:26,292 --> 01:30:28,313
Bag End.

565
01:30:30,615 --> 01:30:33,359
Gandalf's fireworks.

566
01:30:33,741 --> 01:30:37,528
The lights in the Party Tree.

567
01:30:39,002 --> 01:30:42,149
Rosie Cotton dancing.

568
01:30:43,272 --> 01:30:45,985
She had ribbons in her hair.

569
01:30:48,899 --> 01:30:51,860
If ever I was to marry someone...

570
01:30:52,754 --> 01:30:55,025
it would've been her.

571
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:58,525
It would've been her.

572
01:31:10,619 --> 01:31:13,867
I'm glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee...

573
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:21,077
here at the end of all things.

574
01:33:10,631 --> 01:33:12,710
Gandalf?

575
01:33:32,301 --> 01:33:34,333
Frodo!

576
01:33:54,073 --> 01:33:55,919
Gimli!

577
01:35:38,771 --> 01:35:42,558
Now come the days of the king.

578
01:35:47,523 --> 01:35:49,887
May they be blessed.

579
01:36:10,129 --> 01:36:12,817
This day does not belong to one man...

580
01:36:12,942 --> 01:36:14,856
but to all.

581
01:36:16,484 --> 01:36:19,440
Let us together rebuild this world...

582
01:36:19,609 --> 01:36:23,852
that we may share in the days of peace.

592
01:38:58,167 --> 01:39:00,283
My friends...

593
01:39:05,563 --> 01:39:08,251
you bow to no one.

594
01:39:52,339 --> 01:39:54,502
And thus it was.

595
01:39:54,631 --> 01:39:58,288
A Fourth Age of Middle-earth began.

596
01:39:58,433 --> 01:40:01,001
And the Fellowship of the Ring...

597
01:40:01,142 --> 01:40:05,666
though eternally bound by friendship and love...

598
01:40:05,829 --> 01:40:08,245
was ended.

599
01:40:13,227 --> 01:40:18,047
Thirteen months to the day since
Gandalf sent us on our long journey...

600
01:40:18,174 --> 01:40:22,424
we found ourselves looking upon a familiar sight.

601
01:40:24,947 --> 01:40:27,670
We were home.

602
01:40:34,218 --> 01:40:36,090
Hi.

603
01:40:53,231 --> 01:40:55,466
Hey, watch the pumpkin.

604
01:41:43,496 --> 01:41:45,094
More of the same, Rosie.

605
01:41:45,268 --> 01:41:47,257
Good night, lads.

606
01:42:44,753 --> 01:42:48,768
How do you pick up the threads of an old life?

607
01:42:50,066 --> 01:42:52,312
How do you go on...

608
01:42:52,462 --> 01:42:57,685
when in your heart you begin to understand...

609
01:42:58,921 --> 01:43:01,892
there is no going back?

610
01:43:02,567 --> 01:43:06,271
There are some things that time cannot mend...

611
01:43:06,734 --> 01:43:09,691
some hurts that go too deep...

612
01:43:11,422 --> 01:43:14,276
that have taken hold.

613
01:43:52,363 --> 01:43:54,278
Mr. Frodo?

614
01:43:57,573 --> 01:43:58,989
What is it?

615
01:44:00,801 --> 01:44:04,769
It's been four years to the day since Weathertop, Sam.

616
01:44:05,438 --> 01:44:08,150
It's never really healed.

617
01:44:12,105 --> 01:44:17,366
"There and Back Again." A
Hobbit's tale by Bilbo Baggins.

618
01:44:18,043 --> 01:44:21,898
And "The Lord of the Rings" by Frodo Baggins.

619
01:44:22,367 --> 01:44:24,565
You finished it.

620
01:44:27,420 --> 01:44:28,944
Not quite.

621
01:44:29,712 --> 01:44:32,320
There's room for a little more.

622
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:39,159
Bilbo once told me his part in this tale would end...

623
01:44:39,295 --> 01:44:42,610
that each of us must come and go in the telling.

624
01:44:43,463 --> 01:44:46,326
Bilbo's story was now over.

625
01:44:46,796 --> 01:44:49,742
There would be no more journeys for him...

626
01:44:49,870 --> 01:44:51,451
save one.

627
01:44:52,162 --> 01:44:55,808
Tell me again, lad, where are we going?

628
01:44:55,912 --> 01:44:57,944
To the harbor, Bilbo.

629
01:44:58,100 --> 01:45:00,822
The Elves have accorded you a special honor...

630
01:45:00,964 --> 01:45:03,615
a place on the last ship to leave Middle-earth.

631
01:45:05,287 --> 01:45:06,988
Frodo...

632
01:45:08,413 --> 01:45:12,952
any chance of seeing that old Ring of mine again?

633
01:45:13,571 --> 01:45:15,820
The one I gave you.

634
01:45:19,456 --> 01:45:21,612
I'm sorry, Uncle.

635
01:45:24,144 --> 01:45:26,784
I'm afraid I lost it.

636
01:45:26,957 --> 01:45:28,747
Oh.

637
01:45:29,300 --> 01:45:30,831
Pity.

638
01:45:33,571 --> 01:45:37,446
I should like to have held it one last time.

639
01:46:06,544 --> 01:46:11,623
Well, here's a sight I have never seen before.

640
01:46:25,765 --> 01:46:29,127
The power of the Three Rings is ended.

641
01:46:29,879 --> 01:46:32,706
The time has come...

642
01:46:32,848 --> 01:46:36,131
for the dominion of Men.

643
01:46:36,571 --> 01:46:39,569
[Sindarin] <i>I Aear cân ven na mar.</i>
[English] The sea calls us to home.

644
01:46:48,527 --> 01:46:50,705
I think I'm...

645
01:46:50,872 --> 01:46:55,255
quite ready for another adventure.

646
01:47:26,292 --> 01:47:28,588
Farewell...

647
01:47:28,739 --> 01:47:31,510
my brave Hobbits.

648
01:47:33,428 --> 01:47:35,460
My work is now finished.

649
01:47:39,262 --> 01:47:44,258
Here at last, on the shores of the sea...

650
01:47:44,887 --> 01:47:47,762
comes the end of our Fellowship.

651
01:47:51,294 --> 01:47:53,794
I will not say, "Do not weep"...

652
01:47:54,471 --> 01:47:58,465
for not all tears are an evil.

653
01:48:15,984 --> 01:48:17,923
It is time, Frodo.

654
01:48:23,433 --> 01:48:25,465
What does he mean?

655
01:48:27,912 --> 01:48:30,801
We set out to save the Shire, Sam.

656
01:48:32,392 --> 01:48:35,142
And it has been saved.

657
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:41,476
But not for me.

658
01:48:42,393 --> 01:48:44,847
You don't mean that.

659
01:48:46,039 --> 01:48:48,134
You can't leave.

660
01:48:56,561 --> 01:48:59,305
The last pages are for you, Sam.

661
01:52:32,208 --> 01:52:35,077
My dear Sam

662
01:52:37,001 --> 01:52:40,330
You cannot always be torn in two.

663
01:52:40,490 --> 01:52:44,625
You will have to be one and whole for many years.

664
01:52:45,230 --> 01:52:50,828
You have so much to enjoy and to be and to do.

665
01:52:51,950 --> 01:52:55,248
Your part in the story will go on.

666
01:52:55,961 --> 01:52:57,744
Well...

667
01:52:59,607 --> 01:53:01,334
I'm back.

668
01:58:58,632 --> 01:59:04,082
...into the west.
