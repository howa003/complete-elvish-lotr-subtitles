5
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:16,676
Smeagol!

6
00:01:17,603 --> 00:01:19,845
I've got one!

7
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:22,474
I've got a fish, Smea... Smeagol!

8
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,768
Pull it in. Go on. Go on. Go on. Pull it in.

9
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:35,821
Deagol!

10
00:02:33,217 --> 00:02:35,044
Deagol?

11
00:02:37,597 --> 00:02:39,837
Deagol.

12
00:02:55,655 --> 00:02:57,731
Give us that, Deagol, my love.

13
00:03:02,704 --> 00:03:03,985
Why?

14
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:07,323
Because...

15
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:11,248
it's my birthday and I wants it.

16
00:04:45,303 --> 00:04:50,546
My precious.

17
00:04:58,106 --> 00:05:01,023
They cursed us.

18
00:05:01,192 --> 00:05:02,568
Murderer.

19
00:05:02,737 --> 00:05:05,192
"Murderer" they called us.

20
00:05:05,364 --> 00:05:10,154
They cursed us and drove us away.

21
00:05:11,285 --> 00:05:12,993
Gollum.

22
00:05:13,161 --> 00:05:14,870
Gollum.

23
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,995
Gollum.

24
00:05:20,545 --> 00:05:23,545
And we wept, precious.

25
00:05:23,713 --> 00:05:27,296
We wept to be so alone.

26
00:05:29,886 --> 00:05:33,670
- and cool
- So nice for feet

27
00:05:34,683 --> 00:05:39,060
And we only wish To catch a fish

28
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:42,479
So juicy sweet

29
00:05:48,238 --> 00:05:52,364
And we forgot the taste of bread...

30
00:05:52,532 --> 00:05:56,151
the sound of trees...

31
00:05:57,037 --> 00:06:00,241
the softness of the wind.

32
00:06:00,874 --> 00:06:06,544
We even forgot our own name.

33
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:21,096
My precious.

34
00:07:05,353 --> 00:07:07,594
Wake up!

35
00:07:08,648 --> 00:07:10,308
Wake up!

36
00:07:10,483 --> 00:07:12,275
Wake up, sleepies.

37
00:07:12,443 --> 00:07:14,316
We must go, yes.

38
00:07:14,487 --> 00:07:17,156
We must go at once.

39
00:07:20,701 --> 00:07:23,785
Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?

40
00:07:25,998 --> 00:07:28,536
I've gone and had too much.

41
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:31,661
Must be getting late.

42
00:07:31,836 --> 00:07:33,331
No.

43
00:07:33,505 --> 00:07:35,413
It isn't.

44
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:38,626
It isn't midday yet.

45
00:07:38,802 --> 00:07:41,375
The days are growing darker.

46
00:07:45,642 --> 00:07:47,849
Come on!

47
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,512
Must go! No time!

48
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:55,061
Not before Mr. Frodo's had something to eat.

49
00:07:55,234 --> 00:07:58,105
No time to lose, silly.

50
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,150
Here.

51
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,202
What about you?

52
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:16,746
Oh, no, I'm not hungry.
Leastways, not for lembas bread.

53
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,714
Sam.

54
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:22,843
All right.

55
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,501
We don't have that much left.

56
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,550
We have to be careful or we're going to run out.

57
00:08:30,727 --> 00:08:33,644
You go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.

58
00:08:33,812 --> 00:08:35,223
I've rationed it.

59
00:08:35,731 --> 00:08:37,391
There should be enough.

60
00:08:39,568 --> 00:08:40,766
For what?

61
00:08:42,446 --> 00:08:44,189
The journey home.

62
00:08:52,038 --> 00:08:54,363
Come, Hobbitses.

63
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,624
Very close now.

64
00:08:57,794 --> 00:09:01,044
Very close to Mordor.

65
00:09:01,214 --> 00:09:03,882
No safe places here.

66
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:06,208
Hurry.

67
00:09:58,603 --> 00:10:00,311
It's good.

68
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:02,973
Definitely from the Shire.

69
00:10:05,192 --> 00:10:07,315
Longbottom Leaf.

70
00:10:12,658 --> 00:10:16,988
I feel like I'm back at The Green Dragon.

71
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,329
- Green Dragon.
- A mug of ale in my hand.

72
00:10:21,499 --> 00:10:26,078
Putting my feet up on a settle after a hard day's work.

73
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:30,122
Only, you've never done a hard day's work.

74
00:10:42,937 --> 00:10:45,973
Welcome, my lords...

75
00:10:46,148 --> 00:10:48,389
to Isengard!

76
00:10:48,775 --> 00:10:52,524
You young rascals! A merry hunt you've led us on...

77
00:10:52,696 --> 00:10:57,690
and now we find you feasting and... and smoking!

78
00:10:57,868 --> 00:11:01,035
We are sitting on a field of victory...

79
00:11:01,204 --> 00:11:04,703
enjoying a few well-earned comforts.

80
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:09,624
The salted pork is particularly good.

81
00:11:10,172 --> 00:11:12,544
Salted pork?

82
00:11:13,758 --> 00:11:17,173
- Hobbits.
- We're under orders from Treebeard...

83
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:20,179
who's taken over management of Isengard.

84
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:25,726
Young Master Gandalf.

85
00:11:25,895 --> 00:11:30,474
I'm glad you've come.

86
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:35,061
Wood and water, stock and stone I can master.

87
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:38,902
But there is a wizard to manage here...

88
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,067
locked in his tower.

89
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,074
Show yourself.

90
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,037
Be careful.

91
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:50,501
Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.

92
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,791
Well, let's just have his head and be done with it.

93
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,001
No.

94
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,664
We need him alive.

95
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:01,249
We need him to talk.

96
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:07,349
You have fought many wars and
slain many men, Theoden King...

97
00:12:07,517 --> 00:12:09,011
and made peace afterwards.

98
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:14,144
Can we not take counsel together
as we once did, my old friend?

99
00:12:14,315 --> 00:12:17,519
Can we not have peace, you and I?

100
00:12:17,694 --> 00:12:19,603
We shall have peace.

101
00:12:21,531 --> 00:12:23,654
We shall have peace...

102
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:27,869
when you answer for the burning of the Westfold...

103
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,788
and the children that lie dead there!

104
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,705
We shall have peace when the lives of the soldiers...

105
00:12:35,878 --> 00:12:37,955
whose bodies were hewn even as they lay dead...

106
00:12:38,131 --> 00:12:41,666
against the gates of the Hornburg, are avenged!

107
00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:48,805
When you hang from a gibbet for
the sport of your own crows...

108
00:12:49,724 --> 00:12:51,967
we shall have peace.

109
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,434
Gibbets and crows?

110
00:12:57,775 --> 00:12:59,019
Dotard!

111
00:13:00,484 --> 00:13:03,319
What do you want, Gandalf Greyhame?

112
00:13:04,321 --> 00:13:06,813
Let me guess. The Key of Orthanc.

113
00:13:06,991 --> 00:13:09,909
Or perhaps the Keys of Barad-dur itself...

114
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:14,075
along with the crowns of the seven
kings and the rods of the Five Wizards!

115
00:13:14,249 --> 00:13:17,201
Your treachery has already cost many lives.

116
00:13:17,376 --> 00:13:19,748
Thousands more are now at risk.

117
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,292
But you could save them, Saruman.

118
00:13:22,464 --> 00:13:24,752
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

119
00:13:24,925 --> 00:13:28,211
So you have come here for information.

120
00:13:29,096 --> 00:13:30,923
I have some for you.

121
00:13:36,394 --> 00:13:39,348
Something festers in the heart of Middle-earth.

122
00:13:39,522 --> 00:13:41,764
Something that you have failed to see.

123
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:47,776
But the Great Eye has seen it.

124
00:13:48,823 --> 00:13:52,523
Even now he presses his advantage.

125
00:13:54,286 --> 00:13:57,620
His attack will come soon.

126
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,957
You're all going to die.

127
00:14:04,463 --> 00:14:07,713
But you know this, don't you, Gandalf?

128
00:14:07,883 --> 00:14:12,509
You cannot think that this Ranger will
ever sit upon the throne of Gondor.

129
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:18,765
This exile, crept from the
shadows, will never be crowned king.

130
00:14:20,104 --> 00:14:23,768
Gandalf does not hesitate to
sacrifice those closest to him...

131
00:14:24,691 --> 00:14:26,897
those he professes to love.

132
00:14:27,944 --> 00:14:32,486
Tell me, what words of comfort
did you give the Halfling...

133
00:14:32,656 --> 00:14:35,693
before you sent him to his doom?

134
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,830
The path that you have set
him on can only lead to death.

135
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:45,325
I've heard enough!

136
00:14:45,502 --> 00:14:47,328
Shoot him. Stick an arrow in his gob.

137
00:14:47,837 --> 00:14:49,497
No.

138
00:14:49,965 --> 00:14:52,172
Come down, Saruman...

139
00:14:52,343 --> 00:14:56,292
- and your life will be spared.
- Save your pity and your mercy.

140
00:14:56,472 --> 00:14:57,800
I have no use for it!

141
00:15:07,022 --> 00:15:08,481
Saruman...

142
00:15:09,526 --> 00:15:12,693
your staff is broken.

143
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:27,033
Grima, you need not follow him.

144
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,879
You were not always as you are now.

145
00:15:31,046 --> 00:15:33,881
You were once a Man of Rohan.

146
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:35,294
Come down.

147
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:38,172
A Man of Rohan?

148
00:15:39,096 --> 00:15:41,337
What is the house of Rohan...

149
00:15:41,514 --> 00:15:45,180
but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek...

150
00:15:45,351 --> 00:15:49,052
and their brats roll on the floor with the dogs?

151
00:15:49,564 --> 00:15:56,017
The victory at Helm's Deep does not
belong to you, Theoden Horse-master.

152
00:15:56,654 --> 00:16:01,231
You are a lesser son of greater sires.

153
00:16:03,577 --> 00:16:05,285
Grima...

154
00:16:06,122 --> 00:16:07,995
come down.

155
00:16:08,332 --> 00:16:09,743
Be free of him.

156
00:16:09,918 --> 00:16:13,914
- Free? He will never be free.
- No.

157
00:16:14,295 --> 00:16:16,917
Get down, cur!

158
00:16:18,674 --> 00:16:19,956
Saruman!

159
00:16:20,135 --> 00:16:22,756
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

160
00:16:23,263 --> 00:16:25,422
Tell us what you know!

161
00:16:26,934 --> 00:16:32,175
You withdraw your guard, and I will
tell you where your doom will be decided.

162
00:16:32,354 --> 00:16:35,889
I will not be held prisoner here.

163
00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:04,552
Send word to all our allies...

164
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:07,637
and to every corner of
Middle-earth that still stands free.

165
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,302
The enemy moves against us. We
need to know where he will strike.

166
00:17:30,494 --> 00:17:34,444
The filth of Saruman...

167
00:17:34,623 --> 00:17:38,454
is washing away.

168
00:17:38,627 --> 00:17:43,169
Trees will come back to live here.

169
00:17:43,672 --> 00:17:45,831
Young trees.

170
00:17:46,009 --> 00:17:48,215
- Wild trees.
- Pippin!

171
00:17:57,686 --> 00:17:59,845
Bless my bark!

172
00:18:00,022 --> 00:18:01,895
Peregrin Took!

173
00:18:02,066 --> 00:18:04,688
I'll take that, my lad.

174
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,735
Quickly, now.

175
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:02,496
Tonight we remember those who gave
their blood to defend this country.

176
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,206
Hail the victorious dead.

177
00:19:05,376 --> 00:19:06,787
Hail!

178
00:19:17,764 --> 00:19:19,673
No pauses.

179
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:24,013
- No spills.
- And no regurgitation.

180
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,179
So it's a drinking game?

181
00:19:27,731 --> 00:19:30,436
Last one standing wins.

182
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,773
What'll we drink to? Let's drink to victory!

183
00:19:36,949 --> 00:19:38,360
To victory!

184
00:19:50,546 --> 00:19:52,696
[Rohirric] <i>Westu Aragorn hál.</i>
[English] Be-thou Aragorn well!

185
00:20:22,326 --> 00:20:23,986
I am happy for you.

186
00:20:24,369 --> 00:20:26,777
He is an honorable man.

187
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:29,660
You are both honorable men.

188
00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:36,839
It was not Theoden of Rohan
who led our people to victory.

189
00:20:45,014 --> 00:20:46,840
Don't listen to me.

190
00:20:47,683 --> 00:20:49,177
You are young.

191
00:20:49,351 --> 00:20:51,677
And tonight is for you.

192
00:21:06,034 --> 00:21:07,694
Here, here.

193
00:21:09,204 --> 00:21:15,123
It's the Dwarves that go
swimming with little, hairy women.

194
00:21:20,507 --> 00:21:21,751
I feel something.

195
00:21:23,885 --> 00:21:26,374
A slight tingle in my fingers.

196
00:21:27,095 --> 00:21:28,672
I think it's affecting me.

197
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:32,307
What did I say?

198
00:21:32,476 --> 00:21:35,810
He can't hold his liquor.

199
00:21:43,152 --> 00:21:44,481
Game over.

200
00:21:44,653 --> 00:21:48,070
Oh, you can search far and wide
You can drink the whole town dry

201
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,191
But you'll never find a beer so brown
But you'll never find a beer so brown

202
00:21:52,371 --> 00:21:56,746
As the one we drink in our hometown
As the one we drink in our hometown

203
00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:00,830
You can drink your fancy ales
You can drink them by the flagon

204
00:22:01,003 --> 00:22:04,169
But the only brew for the brave and true

205
00:22:06,802 --> 00:22:08,081
Pippin!

206
00:22:08,553 --> 00:22:11,588
But the only brew for the brave and true

207
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,635
Comes from The Green Dragon

208
00:22:17,353 --> 00:22:20,187
Thank you! I win!

209
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,431
No news of Frodo?

210
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:28,109
No word. Nothing.

211
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:31,105
We have time.

212
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:35,902
Every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor.

213
00:22:36,662 --> 00:22:38,738
Do we know that?

214
00:22:42,585 --> 00:22:44,293
What does your heart tell you?

215
00:22:51,344 --> 00:22:54,676
That Frodo is alive.

216
00:22:56,848 --> 00:22:58,640
Yes.

217
00:23:01,228 --> 00:23:03,386
Yes, he's alive.

218
00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:08,483
Too risky. Too risky.

219
00:23:08,651 --> 00:23:09,896
Thieves.

220
00:23:10,069 --> 00:23:12,108
They stole it from us.

221
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:15,779
Kill them. Kill them. Kill them both.

222
00:23:17,827 --> 00:23:20,662
Quiet! Mustn't wake them.

223
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:23,367
Mustn't ruin it now.

224
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,617
But they knows.

225
00:23:25,793 --> 00:23:27,666
They knows.

226
00:23:27,836 --> 00:23:30,457
They suspects us.

227
00:23:31,673 --> 00:23:35,208
What's it saying, my precious, my love?

228
00:23:35,386 --> 00:23:38,967
Is Smeagol losing his nerve?

229
00:23:39,639 --> 00:23:42,011
No. Not.

230
00:23:42,184 --> 00:23:46,430
Never. Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses.

231
00:23:46,604 --> 00:23:51,433
Smeagol wants to see them dead.

232
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:54,147
And we will.

233
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,365
Smeagol did it once. He can do it again.

234
00:24:01,702 --> 00:24:04,372
It's ours!

235
00:24:04,538 --> 00:24:07,208
Ours!

236
00:24:08,334 --> 00:24:11,204
We must get the precious. We must get it back.

237
00:24:11,378 --> 00:24:14,794
Patience! Patience, my love.

238
00:24:14,965 --> 00:24:19,343
First we must lead them to her.

239
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:25,213
We lead them to the Winding Stair.

240
00:24:25,392 --> 00:24:28,061
Yes, the stairs. And then?

241
00:24:28,228 --> 00:24:31,228
Up, up, up, up, up the stairs we go...

242
00:24:31,398 --> 00:24:37,814
until we come to the tunnel.

243
00:24:38,195 --> 00:24:41,315
And when they go in...

244
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:44,278
there's no coming out.

245
00:24:45,203 --> 00:24:48,074
She's always hungry.

246
00:24:48,832 --> 00:24:53,041
She always needs to feed.

247
00:24:53,209 --> 00:24:54,620
She must eat.

248
00:24:54,795 --> 00:24:56,917
All she gets is filthy Orcses.

249
00:24:57,089 --> 00:24:59,840
And they doesn't taste very nice, does they, precious?

250
00:25:00,468 --> 00:25:02,092
No.

251
00:25:02,261 --> 00:25:06,969
Not very nice at all, my love.

252
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,927
She hungers for sweeter meats.

253
00:25:10,101 --> 00:25:11,928
Hobbit meat.

254
00:25:12,102 --> 00:25:16,931
And when she throws away the
bones and the empty clothes...

255
00:25:17,108 --> 00:25:20,193
then we will find it.

256
00:25:20,362 --> 00:25:24,689
And take it for me!

257
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,861
For us.

258
00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:31,370
Yes. We meant "for us."

259
00:25:31,538 --> 00:25:34,991
Gollum. Gollum.

260
00:25:35,168 --> 00:25:39,663
The precious will be ours...

261
00:25:39,837 --> 00:25:44,334
once the Hobbitses are dead!

262
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:46,302
You treacherous little toad!

263
00:25:49,013 --> 00:25:51,301
No! No! Master!

264
00:25:51,473 --> 00:25:53,099
No, Sam! Leave him alone!

265
00:25:53,977 --> 00:25:56,646
I heard it from his own mouth. He means to murder us.

266
00:25:56,812 --> 00:26:00,976
Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly.

267
00:26:02,485 --> 00:26:05,058
He's a horrid, fat Hobbit...

268
00:26:05,238 --> 00:26:06,815
who hates Smeagol...

269
00:26:06,988 --> 00:26:09,777
and who makes up nasty lies.

270
00:26:09,951 --> 00:26:12,619
You miserable little maggot! I'll stove your head in!

271
00:26:12,995 --> 00:26:14,275
Sam!

272
00:26:14,663 --> 00:26:16,952
Call me a liar? You're a liar!

273
00:26:17,916 --> 00:26:21,829
- You scare him off, we're lost!
- I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.

274
00:26:22,003 --> 00:26:25,170
- I won't wait around for him to kill us!
- I'm not sending him away.

275
00:26:25,506 --> 00:26:26,835
You don't see it, do you?

276
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:28,669
He's a villain.

277
00:26:29,678 --> 00:26:33,296
We can't do this by ourselves,
Sam. Not without a guide.

278
00:26:34,141 --> 00:26:37,010
I need you on my side.

279
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:40,135
I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.

280
00:26:41,647 --> 00:26:44,602
I know, Sam. I know.

281
00:26:45,151 --> 00:26:47,144
Trust me.

282
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,692
Come, Smeagol.

283
00:27:57,637 --> 00:27:59,096
What time is it?

284
00:28:01,433 --> 00:28:02,927
Not yet dawn.

285
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:12,893
I dreamed I saw a great wave...

286
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:17,067
climbing over green lands and above the hills.

287
00:28:18,324 --> 00:28:20,778
I stood upon the brink.

288
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:24,868
It was utterly dark in the abyss before my feet.

289
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:29,577
A light shone behind me...

290
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,618
but I could not turn.

291
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:36,211
I could only stand there, waiting.

292
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:40,379
Night changes many thoughts.

293
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,920
Sleep, Eowyn.

294
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:45,714
Sleep...

295
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:50,309
while you can.

296
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,749
The stars are veiled.

297
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:21,254
Something stirs in the east.

298
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:25,045
A sleepless malice.

299
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,843
The Eye of the enemy is moving.

300
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,985
What are you doing?

301
00:29:50,619 --> 00:29:52,078
Pippin!

302
00:29:59,588 --> 00:30:01,331
Pippin?

303
00:30:14,226 --> 00:30:15,555
Pippin.

304
00:30:16,229 --> 00:30:18,897
- What, are you mad?
- I just want to look at it.

305
00:30:19,064 --> 00:30:20,178
Just one more time.

306
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,516
Put it back.

307
00:30:32,787 --> 00:30:34,577
Pippin.

308
00:30:41,085 --> 00:30:42,580
No!

309
00:30:47,675 --> 00:30:48,920
Pippin.

310
00:30:52,263 --> 00:30:53,461
He is here.

311
00:30:53,639 --> 00:30:55,927
I see you.

312
00:30:58,935 --> 00:31:00,560
Pippin!

313
00:31:15,202 --> 00:31:17,952
Help! Gandalf, help!

314
00:31:19,705 --> 00:31:21,578
Someone help him!

315
00:31:27,964 --> 00:31:29,162
Pippin!

316
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,544
Fool of a Took!

317
00:31:52,653 --> 00:31:54,860
Look at me.

318
00:31:56,824 --> 00:32:00,953
Gandalf, forgive me.

319
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:02,994
Look at me.

320
00:32:03,163 --> 00:32:04,991
What did you see?

321
00:32:08,502 --> 00:32:10,578
A tree.

322
00:32:11,547 --> 00:32:13,421
There was a white tree...

323
00:32:13,591 --> 00:32:15,086
in a courtyard of stone.

324
00:32:17,887 --> 00:32:19,166
It was dead.

325
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,176
The city was burning.

326
00:32:25,351 --> 00:32:28,721
Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?

327
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:31,436
I saw...

328
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,195
I saw him.

329
00:32:39,199 --> 00:32:41,441
I could hear his voice in my head.

330
00:32:41,618 --> 00:32:44,025
And what did you tell him?

331
00:32:44,203 --> 00:32:46,030
Speak!

332
00:32:50,209 --> 00:32:53,375
He asked me my name. I didn't answer.

333
00:32:53,546 --> 00:32:55,005
He hurt me.

334
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:57,628
What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?

335
00:33:01,137 --> 00:33:03,591
There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.

336
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,673
A fool...

337
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:09,139
but an honest fool he remains.

338
00:33:09,603 --> 00:33:13,138
He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.

339
00:33:14,191 --> 00:33:16,562
We've been strangely fortunate.

340
00:33:16,734 --> 00:33:20,601
Pippin saw in the palantir a
glimpse of the enemy's plan.

341
00:33:21,531 --> 00:33:25,481
Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith.

342
00:33:26,078 --> 00:33:29,826
His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing.

343
00:33:29,998 --> 00:33:32,322
He knows the heir of Elendil has come forth.

344
00:33:32,499 --> 00:33:34,622
Men are not as weak as he supposed.

345
00:33:34,793 --> 00:33:38,577
There is courage still, strength
enough perhaps to challenge him.

346
00:33:38,797 --> 00:33:40,671
Sauron fears this.

347
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:45,171
He will not risk the peoples of
Middle-earth uniting under one banner.

348
00:33:46,346 --> 00:33:48,754
He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground...

349
00:33:48,932 --> 00:33:52,431
before he sees a king return to the throne of Men.

350
00:33:52,602 --> 00:33:56,516
If the beacons of Gondor are
lit, Rohan must be ready for war.

351
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,647
Tell me...

352
00:33:59,818 --> 00:34:03,601
why should we ride to the aid of
those who did not come to ours?

353
00:34:07,491 --> 00:34:09,318
What do we owe Gondor?

354
00:34:10,452 --> 00:34:12,492
- I will go.
- No!

355
00:34:12,663 --> 00:34:15,828
- They must be warned.
- They will be.

356
00:34:19,253 --> 00:34:21,791
You must come to Minas Tirith by another road.

357
00:34:22,339 --> 00:34:26,800
Follow the river. Look to the black ships.

358
00:34:27,761 --> 00:34:29,719
Understand this:

359
00:34:29,888 --> 00:34:33,553
Things are now in motion that cannot be undone.

360
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,135
I ride for Minas Tirith...

361
00:34:39,397 --> 00:34:42,067
and I won't be going alone.

362
00:34:43,818 --> 00:34:47,482
Of all the inquisitive Hobbits,
Peregrin Took, you are the worst.

363
00:34:48,488 --> 00:34:50,149
Hurry! Hurry!

364
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,069
Where are we going?

365
00:34:53,244 --> 00:34:54,489
Why did you look?

366
00:34:54,663 --> 00:34:57,413
Why do you always have to look?

367
00:34:57,581 --> 00:35:00,664
- I don't know. I can't help it.
- You never can.

368
00:35:01,126 --> 00:35:02,536
I'm sorry, all right?

369
00:35:04,629 --> 00:35:07,547
- I won't do it again.
- Don't you understand?

370
00:35:08,301 --> 00:35:10,257
The enemy thinks you have the Ring.

371
00:35:10,427 --> 00:35:14,175
He's going to be looking for you,
Pip. They have to get you out of here.

372
00:35:15,598 --> 00:35:18,268
And you...? You're coming with me?

373
00:35:20,478 --> 00:35:21,888
Merry?

374
00:35:22,063 --> 00:35:23,343
Come on.

375
00:35:28,862 --> 00:35:30,237
How far is Minas Tirith?

376
00:35:30,404 --> 00:35:33,025
Three days' ride, as the Nazgul flies.

377
00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:36,698
And you better hope we don't
have one of those on our tail.

378
00:35:37,411 --> 00:35:38,905
Here.

379
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:40,871
Something for the road.

380
00:35:41,749 --> 00:35:43,706
The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

381
00:35:43,877 --> 00:35:47,873
I know you've run out. You smoke too much, Pippin.

382
00:35:48,046 --> 00:35:50,537
But... But we'll see each other soon.

383
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:56,376
- Won't we?
- I don't know.

384
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,429
I don't know what's going to happen.

385
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,308
- Merry.
- Run, Shadowfax.

386
00:36:02,477 --> 00:36:03,935
Show us the meaning of haste.

387
00:36:04,103 --> 00:36:06,013
Merry!

388
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:17,604
Merry!

389
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:29,578
He's always followed me...

390
00:36:30,253 --> 00:36:32,292
everywhere I went...

391
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,421
since before we were tweens.

392
00:36:35,592 --> 00:36:39,506
I would get him into the worst sort of trouble...

393
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:41,755
but I was always there to get him out.

394
00:36:44,224 --> 00:36:46,099
Now he's gone.

395
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:50,687
Just like Frodo and Sam.

396
00:36:51,315 --> 00:36:54,067
One thing I have learned about Hobbits:

397
00:36:54,235 --> 00:36:55,896
They're a most hardy folk.

398
00:36:56,445 --> 00:37:00,145
Foolhardy, maybe. He's a Took.

399
00:37:14,629 --> 00:37:16,917
Take her by the safest road.

400
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:19,581
A ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens.

401
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:23,626
It waits to carry her across the sea.

402
00:37:23,804 --> 00:37:27,175
The last journey of Arwen Undomiel.

403
00:38:32,787 --> 00:38:35,872
There is nothing for you here...

404
00:38:36,374 --> 00:38:38,581
only death.

405
00:38:45,883 --> 00:38:47,164
Lady Arwen...

406
00:38:48,094 --> 00:38:50,002
we cannot delay.

407
00:38:52,473 --> 00:38:53,717
My lady!

408
00:39:13,118 --> 00:39:15,739
- Tell me what you have seen.
- Arwen.

409
00:39:15,912 --> 00:39:17,869
You have the gift of foresight.

410
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:19,831
What did you see?

411
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:23,792
I looked into your future, and I saw death.

412
00:39:24,337 --> 00:39:26,459
But there is also life.

413
00:39:28,382 --> 00:39:32,427
You saw there was a child. You saw my son.

414
00:39:33,054 --> 00:39:35,591
That future is almost gone.

415
00:39:35,765 --> 00:39:37,757
But it is not lost.

416
00:39:40,353 --> 00:39:42,558
Nothing is certain.

417
00:39:44,272 --> 00:39:46,978
Some things are certain.

418
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,614
If I leave him now...

419
00:39:53,782 --> 00:39:56,402
I will regret it forever.

420
00:39:57,493 --> 00:39:59,818
It is time.

421
00:40:05,084 --> 00:40:08,868
From the ashes a fire shall be woken

422
00:40:09,047 --> 00:40:12,462
A light from the shadow shall spring

423
00:40:12,632 --> 00:40:15,918
Renewed shall be blade that was broken

424
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:26,513
The crownless again shall be king

425
00:40:30,275 --> 00:40:32,314
Re-forge the sword.

426
00:40:34,017 --> 00:40:35,017
[Sindarin] <i>Ada.</i>
[English] Father.

427
00:41:07,185 --> 00:41:09,890
Your hands are cold.

428
00:41:13,274 --> 00:41:16,395
The life of the Eldar is leaving you.

429
00:41:19,823 --> 00:41:21,732
This was my choice.

430
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,320
[Sindarin] <i>Ada...</i>
[English] Father...

431
00:41:23,576 --> 00:41:25,864
Whether by your will or not...

432
00:41:27,204 --> 00:41:31,499
there is no ship now that can bear me hence.

433
00:42:18,712 --> 00:42:21,548
We've just passed into the realm of Gondor.

434
00:42:33,185 --> 00:42:35,426
Minas Tirith.

435
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:38,346
City of kings.

436
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:11,511
Make way!

437
00:43:40,707 --> 00:43:42,535
It's the tree.

438
00:43:42,709 --> 00:43:44,369
Gandalf. Gandalf.

439
00:43:44,544 --> 00:43:46,786
Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.

440
00:43:46,963 --> 00:43:48,790
The tree of the king.

441
00:43:48,965 --> 00:43:51,636
Lord Denethor, however, is not king.

442
00:43:51,803 --> 00:43:54,470
He is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne.

443
00:43:55,221 --> 00:43:58,756
Now listen carefully. Lord
Denethor is Boromir's father.

444
00:43:59,309 --> 00:44:03,093
To give him news of his beloved
son's death would be most unwise.

445
00:44:03,562 --> 00:44:07,015
And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.

446
00:44:07,901 --> 00:44:10,652
And say nothing of Aragorn either.

447
00:44:12,488 --> 00:44:16,355
In fact, it's better if you
don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.

448
00:44:46,522 --> 00:44:53,021
Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion,
lord and steward of Gondor.

449
00:44:58,532 --> 00:45:03,241
I come with tidings in this
dark hour, and with counsel.

450
00:45:04,204 --> 00:45:07,573
Perhaps you come to explain this.

451
00:45:13,212 --> 00:45:17,756
Perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead.

452
00:45:32,231 --> 00:45:35,232
Boromir died to save us...

453
00:45:35,402 --> 00:45:37,062
my kinsman and me.

454
00:45:37,236 --> 00:45:40,735
- He fell defending us from many foes.
- Pippin.

455
00:45:46,245 --> 00:45:49,695
I offer you my service, such as it is...

456
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:52,241
in payment of this debt.

457
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:57,752
This is my first command to you.

458
00:45:58,465 --> 00:46:01,916
How did you escape and my son did not...

459
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,585
so mighty a man as he was?

460
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:08,596
The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow...

461
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:10,759
and Boromir was pierced by many.

462
00:46:14,898 --> 00:46:16,605
Get up.

463
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:21,400
My lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir...

464
00:46:21,861 --> 00:46:23,604
but it is not now.

465
00:46:24,322 --> 00:46:26,529
War is coming.

466
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:31,279
The enemy is on your doorstep.
As steward, you are charged...

467
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:35,618
with the defense of this city.
Where are Gondor's armies?

468
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:40,667
You still have friends. You
are not alone in this fight.

469
00:46:40,838 --> 00:46:45,335
Send word to Theoden of Rohan. Light the beacons.

470
00:46:46,928 --> 00:46:50,463
You think you are wise, Mithrandir.

471
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,676
Yet for all your subtleties, you have not wisdom.

472
00:46:55,811 --> 00:46:59,974
Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind?

473
00:47:00,148 --> 00:47:03,234
I have seen more than you know.

474
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:06,605
With your left hand you would
use me as a shield against Mordor.

475
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,650
And with your right you'd seek to supplant me.

476
00:47:09,824 --> 00:47:13,525
I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan.

477
00:47:13,703 --> 00:47:19,659
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears
of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

478
00:47:19,835 --> 00:47:24,662
And I tell you now, I will not bow
to this Ranger from the North...

479
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:29,335
last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship.

480
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:35,347
Authority is not given to you to
deny the return of the king, steward.

481
00:47:35,517 --> 00:47:39,929
The rule of Gondor is mine and no other's.

482
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:46,900
Come.

483
00:47:54,827 --> 00:47:57,400
All has turned to vain ambition.

484
00:47:57,579 --> 00:48:01,030
He would even use his grief as a cloak.

485
00:48:03,919 --> 00:48:06,704
A thousand years this city has stood.

486
00:48:07,797 --> 00:48:10,205
Now, at the whim of a madman, it will fall.

487
00:48:11,426 --> 00:48:13,632
And the White Tree, the tree of the king...

488
00:48:13,803 --> 00:48:15,346
will never bloom again.

489
00:48:15,513 --> 00:48:18,882
- Why are they still guarding it?
- They guard it because they have hope.

490
00:48:19,059 --> 00:48:22,224
A faint and fading hope that one day it will flower.

491
00:48:22,394 --> 00:48:27,139
That a king will come and this
city will be as it once was...

492
00:48:27,317 --> 00:48:30,233
before it fell into decay.

493
00:48:30,403 --> 00:48:33,653
The old wisdom borne out of the West was forsaken.

494
00:48:33,822 --> 00:48:38,115
Kings made tombs more splendid
than the houses of the living...

495
00:48:38,326 --> 00:48:40,235
and counted the old names of their descent...

496
00:48:40,411 --> 00:48:43,198
dearer than the names of their sons.

497
00:48:43,373 --> 00:48:48,414
Childless lords sat in aged
halls, musing on heraldry...

498
00:48:48,587 --> 00:48:53,925
or in high, cold towers, asking questions of the stars.

499
00:48:54,091 --> 00:48:57,875
And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin.

500
00:48:58,846 --> 00:49:01,171
The line of kings failed.

501
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:04,263
The White Tree withered.

502
00:49:04,976 --> 00:49:09,140
The rule of Gondor was given over to lesser men.

503
00:49:19,866 --> 00:49:21,111
Mordor.

504
00:49:21,618 --> 00:49:25,283
Yes, there it lies.

505
00:49:26,122 --> 00:49:29,456
This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow.

506
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:33,120
A storm is coming.

507
00:49:33,796 --> 00:49:36,713
This is not the weather of the world.

508
00:49:36,882 --> 00:49:39,089
This is a device of Sauron's making.

509
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:43,008
A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host.

510
00:49:43,597 --> 00:49:46,052
The Orcs of Mordor have no love of daylight...

511
00:49:46,225 --> 00:49:48,052
so he covers the face of the sun...

512
00:49:48,227 --> 00:49:51,974
to ease their passage along the road to war.

513
00:49:52,147 --> 00:49:55,433
When the Shadow of Mordor reaches this city...

514
00:49:56,151 --> 00:49:57,859
it will begin.

515
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:01,107
Well...

516
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:02,818
Minas Tirith...

517
00:50:04,742 --> 00:50:06,153
very impressive.

518
00:50:06,326 --> 00:50:08,948
- So where are we off to next?
- Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin.

519
00:50:09,121 --> 00:50:11,328
There's no leaving this city.

520
00:50:13,668 --> 00:50:16,871
Help must come to us.

521
00:50:18,381 --> 00:50:21,050
It must be getting near teatime.

522
00:50:21,216 --> 00:50:24,917
Leastways, it would be in decent
places where there is still teatime.

523
00:50:25,095 --> 00:50:28,678
We're not in decent places.

524
00:50:34,229 --> 00:50:35,474
Mr. Frodo?

525
00:50:38,525 --> 00:50:39,722
What is it?

526
00:50:42,195 --> 00:50:44,567
It's just a feeling.

527
00:50:46,992 --> 00:50:49,150
I don't think I'll be coming back.

528
00:50:53,665 --> 00:50:56,202
Yes, you will. Of course you will.

529
00:50:56,834 --> 00:50:58,707
That's just morbid thinking.

530
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:01,625
We're going there and back again...

531
00:51:01,797 --> 00:51:04,086
just like Mr. Bilbo.

532
00:51:05,051 --> 00:51:07,174
You'll see.

533
00:51:15,352 --> 00:51:18,969
I think these lands were once
part of the kingdom of Gondor.

534
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:27,404
Long ago, when there was a king.

535
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:50,884
Mr. Frodo, look.

536
00:51:52,511 --> 00:51:55,263
The king has got a crown again.

537
00:52:06,401 --> 00:52:10,647
Come on, Hobbits! Mustn't stop now. This way.

538
00:52:27,504 --> 00:52:31,550
So I imagine this is just a ceremonial position.

539
00:52:31,717 --> 00:52:35,964
I mean, they don't actually
expect me to do any fighting.

540
00:52:36,805 --> 00:52:40,055
- Do they?
- You're in the service of the steward now.

541
00:52:40,224 --> 00:52:43,594
You'll have to do as you're told, Peregrin Took.

542
00:52:47,647 --> 00:52:50,140
Ridiculous Hobbit.

543
00:52:51,319 --> 00:52:53,525
Guard of the Citadel.

544
00:53:03,038 --> 00:53:04,864
Thank you.

545
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:16,499
There's no more stars.

546
00:53:17,009 --> 00:53:18,208
Is it time?

547
00:53:19,387 --> 00:53:21,130
Yes.

548
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:25,427
It's so quiet.

549
00:53:26,436 --> 00:53:30,683
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

550
00:53:31,858 --> 00:53:34,727
I don't want to be in a battle...

551
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:40,528
but waiting on the edge of one
I can't escape is even worse.

552
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:47,696
Is there any hope, Gandalf, for Frodo and Sam?

553
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,160
There never was much hope.

554
00:53:54,129 --> 00:53:55,872
Just a fool's hope.

555
00:54:01,761 --> 00:54:04,548
Our enemy is ready.

556
00:54:04,722 --> 00:54:07,392
His full strength's gathered.

557
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:11,057
Not only Orcs, but Men as well.

558
00:54:11,229 --> 00:54:14,265
Legions of Haradrim from the south...

559
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:17,144
mercenaries from the coast.

560
00:54:17,318 --> 00:54:19,891
All will answer Mordor's call.

561
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:21,612
Come on.

562
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:26,073
This will be the end of Gondor as we know it.

563
00:54:26,243 --> 00:54:29,612
Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.

564
00:54:30,581 --> 00:54:34,910
If the river is taken, if the
garrison at Osgiliath falls...

565
00:54:35,085 --> 00:54:38,750
the last defense of this city will be gone.

566
00:54:38,922 --> 00:54:42,967
But we have the White Wizard.
That's got to count for something.

567
00:54:48,847 --> 00:54:50,426
Gandalf?

568
00:54:54,145 --> 00:54:57,810
Sauron has yet to reveal his deadliest servant...

569
00:54:58,274 --> 00:55:02,105
the one who will lead Mordor's armies in war.

570
00:55:02,277 --> 00:55:07,438
The one they say no living man can kill.

571
00:55:08,451 --> 00:55:10,609
The Witch King of Angmar.

572
00:55:11,703 --> 00:55:14,076
You've met him before.

573
00:55:14,748 --> 00:55:17,321
He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

574
00:55:23,882 --> 00:55:26,587
He is the lord of the Nazgul...

575
00:55:27,052 --> 00:55:29,508
the greatest of the Nine.

576
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:33,297
Minas Morgul is his lair.

577
00:55:36,769 --> 00:55:40,303
The Dead City.

578
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:45,688
Very nasty place. Full of enemies.

579
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:55,068
Quick. Quick.

580
00:55:55,245 --> 00:55:59,243
They will see. They will see.

581
00:56:08,507 --> 00:56:13,798
Come away. Come away. Look, we have found it.

582
00:56:13,972 --> 00:56:17,839
The way into Mordor.

583
00:56:18,017 --> 00:56:22,347
The secret stair.

584
00:56:22,771 --> 00:56:25,143
Climb.

585
00:56:45,417 --> 00:56:48,169
- No, Mr. Frodo!
- Not that way!

586
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:55,880
- What's it doing?
- No.

587
00:56:56,054 --> 00:56:59,137
- They're calling me.
- No.

588
00:57:28,793 --> 00:57:31,747
Hide! Hide!

589
00:58:15,296 --> 00:58:18,132
I can feel his blade.

590
00:58:29,809 --> 00:58:31,933
We come to it at last.

591
00:58:33,771 --> 00:58:36,643
The great battle of our time.

592
00:59:15,813 --> 00:59:19,062
Come away, Hobbits. We climb. We must climb.

593
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:31,951
The board is set.

594
00:59:32,119 --> 00:59:34,658
The pieces are moving.

595
00:59:37,208 --> 00:59:39,878
Up, up, up the stairs we go.

596
00:59:40,044 --> 00:59:42,712
And then it's into the tunnel.

597
00:59:42,879 --> 00:59:46,084
Hey, what's in this tunnel?

598
00:59:46,633 --> 00:59:49,385
You listen to me, and you listen good and proper.

599
00:59:49,553 --> 00:59:52,471
Anything happens to him, you have me to answer to.

600
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:54,217
One sniff something's not right...

601
00:59:54,392 --> 00:59:57,557
one hair stands up on the back of my head, it's over.

602
00:59:57,768 --> 01:00:00,438
No more slinker. No more stinker.

603
01:00:00,771 --> 01:00:03,394
You're gone. Got it?

604
01:00:04,276 --> 01:00:06,268
I'm watching you.

605
01:00:11,616 --> 01:00:13,608
What was that about?

606
01:00:13,784 --> 01:00:16,191
Nothing. Just clearing something up.

607
01:00:22,835 --> 01:00:25,706
Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task now to be done.

608
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:30,457
Another opportunity for one of the
Shire-folk to prove their great worth.

609
01:00:35,305 --> 01:00:36,884
You must not fail me.

610
01:01:11,130 --> 01:01:14,215
It's been very quiet across the river.

611
01:01:14,384 --> 01:01:16,709
The Orcs are lying low.

612
01:01:16,887 --> 01:01:18,879
The garrison may have moved out.

613
01:01:20,015 --> 01:01:22,719
We've sent scouts to Cair Andros.

614
01:01:22,893 --> 01:01:26,177
If the Orcs attack from the
north, we'll have some warning.

615
01:01:51,503 --> 01:01:52,702
Quiet.

616
01:01:56,799 --> 01:01:58,757
We need 10 more.

617
01:02:20,072 --> 01:02:21,615
Kill him!

618
01:02:38,925 --> 01:02:41,331
They're not coming from the north.

619
01:02:42,761 --> 01:02:47,090
To the river. Quick. Quick. Go. Come on.

620
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,137
Faster.

621
01:03:05,283 --> 01:03:07,655
Draw swords.

622
01:04:02,212 --> 01:04:04,785
Hold! Hold them!

623
01:05:25,082 --> 01:05:26,957
What?

624
01:05:39,513 --> 01:05:40,924
Amon Din

625
01:05:46,729 --> 01:05:49,766
The beacon. The beacon of Amon Din is lit.

626
01:05:53,026 --> 01:05:57,238
Hope is kindled.

627
01:07:29,619 --> 01:07:33,998
The beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons are lit!

628
01:07:35,209 --> 01:07:36,832
Gondor calls for aid.

629
01:07:47,344 --> 01:07:50,262
And Rohan will answer.

630
01:07:50,681 --> 01:07:53,468
Muster the Rohirrim.

631
01:08:08,573 --> 01:08:10,531
Assemble the army at Dunharrow.

632
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:15,078
As many men as can be found. You have two days.

633
01:08:15,246 --> 01:08:20,537
On the third, we ride for Gondor and war.

634
01:08:21,501 --> 01:08:22,830
- Forward.
- Very good, sir.

635
01:08:23,003 --> 01:08:24,331
- Gamling.
- My lord.

636
01:08:24,504 --> 01:08:26,083
Make haste across the Riddermark.

637
01:08:26,258 --> 01:08:28,380
Summon every able-bodied man to Dunharrow.

638
01:08:28,551 --> 01:08:30,129
I will.

639
01:08:34,223 --> 01:08:37,389
- Will you ride with us?
- Just to the encampment.

640
01:08:37,558 --> 01:08:41,473
It's tradition for the women of
the court to farewell the men.

641
01:08:48,028 --> 01:08:49,938
The men have found their captain.

642
01:08:50,114 --> 01:08:53,446
They will follow you into battle, even to death.

643
01:08:53,616 --> 01:08:55,194
You have given us hope.

644
01:08:58,412 --> 01:09:00,370
Excuse me.

645
01:09:01,708 --> 01:09:03,202
I have a sword.

646
01:09:03,502 --> 01:09:04,877
Please accept it.

647
01:09:06,003 --> 01:09:10,499
I offer you my service, Theoden King.

648
01:09:13,927 --> 01:09:16,003
And gladly I accept it.

649
01:09:17,097 --> 01:09:21,177
You shall be Meriadoc, esquire of Rohan.

650
01:09:26,064 --> 01:09:27,262
Horse-Men.

651
01:09:27,941 --> 01:09:33,564
I wish I could muster a legion of
Dwarves, fully armed and filthy.

652
01:09:33,947 --> 01:09:36,901
Your kinsmen may have no need to ride to war.

653
01:09:37,075 --> 01:09:40,491
I fear war already marches on their own lands.

654
01:09:58,971 --> 01:10:02,422
So it is before the walls of Minas Tirith...

655
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:06,466
the doom of our time will be decided.

656
01:10:09,063 --> 01:10:14,604
Now is the hour. Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.

657
01:10:14,778 --> 01:10:18,312
Now, fulfill them all. To lord and land!

658
01:11:01,405 --> 01:11:03,364
Faramir!

659
01:11:09,663 --> 01:11:13,364
We can't hold them. The city is lost.

660
01:11:13,959 --> 01:11:17,043
Tell the men to break cover. We ride for Minas Tirith.

661
01:11:25,804 --> 01:11:28,046
Nazgul.

662
01:11:30,434 --> 01:11:32,889
Take cover!

663
01:11:33,061 --> 01:11:35,598
Nazgul!

664
01:11:35,771 --> 01:11:39,437
Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!

665
01:11:46,032 --> 01:11:47,906
Fall back!

666
01:11:54,957 --> 01:11:59,536
- Retreat! Retreat!
- Run for your lives!

667
01:12:23,776 --> 01:12:28,105
The age of Men is over.

668
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:33,903
The time of the Orc has come.

669
01:12:36,288 --> 01:12:38,613
- Keep going.
- It's the Nazgul.

670
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:42,622
Take cover, my lord!

671
01:12:42,919 --> 01:12:44,248
It's coming!

672
01:12:49,801 --> 01:12:53,170
- It's Mithrandir.
- The White Rider!

673
01:13:33,134 --> 01:13:34,509
Pull!

674
01:13:52,236 --> 01:13:54,643
Mithrandir.

675
01:13:54,821 --> 01:13:56,566
They broke through our defenses.

676
01:13:56,741 --> 01:13:58,947
They've taken the bridge and the west bank.

677
01:14:00,036 --> 01:14:04,198
- Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.
- It is as the Lord Denethor predicted.

678
01:14:04,372 --> 01:14:08,915
- Long has he foreseen this doom.
- Foreseen and done nothing.

679
01:14:12,296 --> 01:14:14,706
Faramir?

680
01:14:16,635 --> 01:14:20,466
This is not the first Halfling
to have crossed your path.

681
01:14:20,638 --> 01:14:22,844
No.

682
01:14:24,183 --> 01:14:25,725
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

683
01:14:26,602 --> 01:14:30,018
- Where? When?
- In Ithilien.

684
01:14:30,189 --> 01:14:32,265
Not two days ago.

685
01:14:32,733 --> 01:14:37,193
Gandalf, they're taking the road to the Morgul Vale.

686
01:14:37,905 --> 01:14:40,526
And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.

687
01:14:42,743 --> 01:14:45,115
What does that mean?

688
01:14:45,287 --> 01:14:50,197
- What's wrong?
- Faramir, tell me everything.

689
01:14:50,375 --> 01:14:52,414
Tell me all you know.

690
01:14:53,587 --> 01:14:57,002
This is how you would serve your city?

691
01:14:57,174 --> 01:15:00,459
You would risk its utter ruin?

692
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:03,087
I did what I judged to be right.

693
01:15:03,803 --> 01:15:06,805
What you judged to be right.

694
01:15:07,433 --> 01:15:13,306
You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor
in the hands of a witless Halfling.

695
01:15:17,275 --> 01:15:22,103
It should have been brought back
to the Citadel to be kept safe.

696
01:15:23,741 --> 01:15:25,283
Hidden.

697
01:15:25,701 --> 01:15:28,453
Dark and deep in the vaults...

698
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:30,779
not to be used.

699
01:15:34,959 --> 01:15:39,835
Unless at the uttermost end of need.

700
01:15:40,299 --> 01:15:42,338
I would not use the Ring.

701
01:15:42,509 --> 01:15:45,594
Not if Minas Tirith were falling
in ruin and I alone could save her.

702
01:15:45,928 --> 01:15:50,755
Ever you desire to appear lordly and gracious...

703
01:15:50,933 --> 01:15:53,175
as a king of old.

704
01:15:54,978 --> 01:15:58,728
Boromir would have remembered his father's need.

705
01:15:59,150 --> 01:16:01,605
He would have brought me a kingly gift.

706
01:16:01,818 --> 01:16:04,356
Boromir would not have brought the Ring.

707
01:16:04,780 --> 01:16:07,899
He would have stretched out his hand to
this thing and taken it. He would've fallen.

708
01:16:08,074 --> 01:16:10,316
- You know nothing of this matter!
- He would have kept it for his own.

709
01:16:12,204 --> 01:16:14,362
And when he returned...

710
01:16:15,498 --> 01:16:17,158
you would not have known your son.

711
01:16:17,333 --> 01:16:19,871
Boromir was loyal to me!

712
01:16:20,044 --> 01:16:22,617
Not some wizard's pupil!

713
01:16:30,762 --> 01:16:32,090
Father?

714
01:16:44,777 --> 01:16:46,685
My son.

715
01:17:12,929 --> 01:17:14,304
Leave me.

716
01:17:47,878 --> 01:17:50,416
Careful, master. Careful.

717
01:17:50,756 --> 01:17:53,674
Very far to fall.

718
01:17:56,178 --> 01:18:00,092
Very dangerous are the stairs.

719
01:18:02,768 --> 01:18:05,306
Come, master.

720
01:18:11,110 --> 01:18:14,275
Come to Smeagol.

721
01:18:20,618 --> 01:18:22,112
Mr. Frodo.

722
01:18:23,121 --> 01:18:24,663
Get back, you!

723
01:18:24,831 --> 01:18:27,037
Don't touch him!

724
01:18:31,169 --> 01:18:34,005
Why does he hates poor Smeagol?

725
01:18:34,173 --> 01:18:37,874
What has Smeagol ever done to him?

726
01:18:38,052 --> 01:18:40,424
Master?

727
01:18:41,221 --> 01:18:44,672
Master carries heavy burden.

728
01:18:44,849 --> 01:18:50,270
Smeagol knows. Heavy, heavy burden.

729
01:18:50,438 --> 01:18:53,689
Fat one cannot know.

730
01:18:55,736 --> 01:18:58,486
Smeagol look after master.

731
01:18:59,697 --> 01:19:01,904
He wants it.

732
01:19:02,074 --> 01:19:06,617
He needs it. Smeagol sees it in his eye.

733
01:19:06,787 --> 01:19:12,244
Very soon he will ask you for it. You will see.

734
01:19:12,419 --> 01:19:16,285
The fat one will take it from you.

735
01:19:23,511 --> 01:19:27,842
Send forth all legions.

736
01:19:28,016 --> 01:19:32,061
Do not stop the attack until the city is taken.

737
01:19:32,771 --> 01:19:35,891
Slay them all.

738
01:19:37,567 --> 01:19:43,355
- What of the wizard?
- I will break him.

739
01:19:46,701 --> 01:19:49,108
Where are Theoden's riders?

740
01:19:49,286 --> 01:19:51,860
Will Rohan's army come?

741
01:19:52,039 --> 01:19:54,281
Mithrandir.

742
01:19:55,334 --> 01:19:59,200
Courage is the best defense that you have now.

743
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:06,714
What were you thinking, Peregrin Took?

744
01:20:08,805 --> 01:20:14,510
What service can a Hobbit
offer such a great lord of Men?

745
01:20:14,685 --> 01:20:16,180
It was well-done.

746
01:20:19,357 --> 01:20:23,402
A generous deed should not
be checked with cold counsel.

747
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:26,692
You are to join the tower guard.

748
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:30,239
I didn't think they would find
any livery that would fit me.

749
01:20:30,409 --> 01:20:32,864
Once belonged to a young boy of the city.

750
01:20:33,036 --> 01:20:34,578
A very foolish one...

751
01:20:34,746 --> 01:20:38,994
who wasted many hours slaying dragons
instead of attending to his studies.

752
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:41,920
- This was yours?
- Yes, it was mine.

753
01:20:42,088 --> 01:20:43,878
My father had it made for me.

754
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:46,252
Well...

755
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:48,416
I'm taller than you were then.

756
01:20:48,593 --> 01:20:51,927
Though I'm not likely to grow anymore, except sideways.

757
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:56,931
Never fitted me either.

758
01:20:57,101 --> 01:20:59,937
Boromir was always the soldier.

759
01:21:02,941 --> 01:21:05,348
They were so alike, he and my father.

760
01:21:07,445 --> 01:21:09,070
Proud.

761
01:21:09,238 --> 01:21:10,437
Stubborn even.

762
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,694
But strong.

763
01:21:15,202 --> 01:21:18,369
I think you have strength of a different kind.

764
01:21:18,998 --> 01:21:21,453
And one day your father will see it.

765
01:21:25,629 --> 01:21:29,413
Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor...

766
01:21:29,591 --> 01:21:31,086
in peace or war...

767
01:21:31,719 --> 01:21:34,174
in living or dying...

768
01:21:35,556 --> 01:21:36,800
from...

769
01:21:39,476 --> 01:21:42,262
From this hour henceforth...

770
01:21:42,436 --> 01:21:44,345
until my lord release me...

771
01:21:45,857 --> 01:21:48,063
or death take me.

772
01:21:48,651 --> 01:21:51,142
And I shall not forget it...

773
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:54,690
nor fail to reward that which is given.

774
01:22:02,289 --> 01:22:04,578
Fealty with love.

775
01:22:05,667 --> 01:22:07,328
Valor with honor.

776
01:22:08,921 --> 01:22:12,253
Disloyalty with vengeance.

777
01:22:20,891 --> 01:22:24,971
I do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses...

778
01:22:25,145 --> 01:22:27,896
defenses that your brother long held intact.

779
01:22:28,063 --> 01:22:30,554
- What would you have me do?
- I will not yield...

780
01:22:30,733 --> 01:22:33,520
the river in Pelennor unfought.

781
01:22:33,694 --> 01:22:35,354
Osgiliath must be retaken.

782
01:22:35,529 --> 01:22:37,570
My lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

783
01:22:38,241 --> 01:22:41,027
Much must be risked in war.

784
01:22:43,662 --> 01:22:47,612
Is there a captain here who still
has the courage to do his lord's will?

785
01:22:53,838 --> 01:22:57,088
You wish now that our places had been exchanged...

786
01:22:58,051 --> 01:23:00,886
that I had died and Boromir had lived.

787
01:23:04,307 --> 01:23:06,050
Yes.

788
01:23:06,726 --> 01:23:08,932
I wish that.

789
01:23:17,319 --> 01:23:19,810
Since you were robbed of Boromir...

790
01:23:21,657 --> 01:23:24,575
I will do what I can in his stead.

791
01:23:32,751 --> 01:23:37,211
If I should return, think better of me, Father.

792
01:23:39,299 --> 01:23:42,916
That will depend on the manner of your return.

793
01:25:06,216 --> 01:25:08,541
What are you up to?

794
01:25:08,718 --> 01:25:09,962
Sneaking off, are we?

795
01:25:10,678 --> 01:25:12,504
Sneaking?

796
01:25:13,514 --> 01:25:15,672
Sneaking?

797
01:25:17,101 --> 01:25:20,267
Fat Hobbit is always so polite.

798
01:25:20,438 --> 01:25:25,513
Smeagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find...

799
01:25:25,692 --> 01:25:27,850
and they say "sneak."

800
01:25:28,486 --> 01:25:31,061
Sneak?

801
01:25:31,698 --> 01:25:34,403
Very nice friend. Oh, yes, my precious.

802
01:25:34,576 --> 01:25:37,198
- Very nice, very nice.
- All right. All right!

803
01:25:38,455 --> 01:25:40,660
You just startled me is all.

804
01:25:41,165 --> 01:25:42,992
What were you doing?

805
01:25:44,627 --> 01:25:46,749
Sneaking.

806
01:25:47,129 --> 01:25:50,215
Fine. Have it your own way.

807
01:25:52,469 --> 01:25:54,959
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.

808
01:25:55,346 --> 01:25:57,302
We have to be moving on.

809
01:26:02,477 --> 01:26:04,055
It's dark still.

810
01:26:04,229 --> 01:26:06,436
It's always dark here.

811
01:26:10,694 --> 01:26:12,602
It's gone!

812
01:26:13,822 --> 01:26:16,692
- The Elven bread.
- What?

813
01:26:16,866 --> 01:26:18,325
That's all we have left.

814
01:26:22,413 --> 01:26:24,905
He took it. He must have!

815
01:26:25,416 --> 01:26:28,667
Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol.

816
01:26:28,836 --> 01:26:31,754
Smeagol hates nasty Elf bread.

817
01:26:31,923 --> 01:26:35,089
You're a lying rat! What did you do with it?!

818
01:26:35,259 --> 01:26:36,801
He doesn't eat it.

819
01:26:37,804 --> 01:26:40,128
- He can't have taken it.
- Look.

820
01:26:41,181 --> 01:26:43,009
What's this?

821
01:26:45,686 --> 01:26:49,020
Crumbs on his jacketses. He took it!

822
01:26:49,731 --> 01:26:51,392
He took it.

823
01:26:52,234 --> 01:26:56,444
I seen him. He's always stuffing
his face when master's not looking.

824
01:26:56,613 --> 01:26:58,405
That's a filthy lie!

825
01:26:58,573 --> 01:27:00,780
You stinking, two-faced sneak!

826
01:27:00,950 --> 01:27:02,196
- Sam!
- Call me...

827
01:27:02,369 --> 01:27:03,614
Stop it!

828
01:27:04,621 --> 01:27:05,819
Sam!

829
01:27:07,123 --> 01:27:10,740
- I'll kill him!
- Sam! No!

830
01:27:11,794 --> 01:27:17,334
Oh, my... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to go so far. I was just so... So angry.

831
01:27:17,508 --> 01:27:19,631
Here, just... Let's
just rest a bit.

832
01:27:19,802 --> 01:27:21,878
- I'm all right.
- No.

833
01:27:22,054 --> 01:27:25,138
No, you're not all right. You're exhausted.

834
01:27:25,306 --> 01:27:27,429
It's that Gollum.

835
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:29,309
It's this place.

836
01:27:29,477 --> 01:27:32,050
It's that thing around your neck.

837
01:27:35,568 --> 01:27:36,848
I could help a bit.

838
01:27:37,027 --> 01:27:39,695
I could carry it for a while.

839
01:27:39,863 --> 01:27:41,606
Carry it for a while.

840
01:27:41,781 --> 01:27:43,026
I could carry it... I could carry it.

841
01:27:43,658 --> 01:27:49,114
Share the load... Share the
load... the load... the load.

842
01:27:49,288 --> 01:27:50,488
Get away!

843
01:27:50,666 --> 01:27:52,242
I don't want to keep it.

844
01:27:55,837 --> 01:27:57,828
I just want to help.

845
01:27:59,882 --> 01:28:02,504
See? See?

846
01:28:02,676 --> 01:28:06,092
He wants it for himself.

847
01:28:06,264 --> 01:28:07,971
Shut up, you!

848
01:28:08,515 --> 01:28:10,342
Go away! Get out of here!

849
01:28:10,517 --> 01:28:12,344
No, Sam.

850
01:28:12,519 --> 01:28:13,764
It's you.

851
01:28:17,983 --> 01:28:19,690
I'm sorry, Sam.

852
01:28:21,361 --> 01:28:22,735
But he's a liar.

853
01:28:22,903 --> 01:28:25,573
He's poisoned you against me.

854
01:28:26,992 --> 01:28:28,900
You can't help me anymore.

855
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:32,743
You don't mean that.

856
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:37,040
Go home.

857
01:29:57,078 --> 01:29:58,869
Faramir!

858
01:29:59,038 --> 01:30:00,947
Faramir!

859
01:30:02,458 --> 01:30:04,498
Your father's will has turned to madness.

860
01:30:05,668 --> 01:30:07,708
Do not throw away your life so rashly.

861
01:30:08,463 --> 01:30:10,789
Where does my allegiance lie if not here?

862
01:30:11,425 --> 01:30:14,343
This is the city of the Men of Numenor.

863
01:30:14,970 --> 01:30:17,757
I will gladly give my life to defend her beauty...

864
01:30:17,931 --> 01:30:21,134
her memory, her wisdom.

865
01:30:23,519 --> 01:30:26,936
Your father loves you, Faramir.

866
01:30:27,649 --> 01:30:30,650
He will remember it before the end.

867
01:31:40,260 --> 01:31:41,802
Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

868
01:31:44,785 --> 01:31:46,279
Well...

869
01:31:46,829 --> 01:31:48,453
yes.

870
01:31:49,165 --> 01:31:52,912
At least, well enough for my own people.

871
01:31:54,545 --> 01:31:56,952
But we have no songs for great halls...

872
01:31:58,006 --> 01:31:59,251
and evil times.

873
01:32:00,091 --> 01:32:03,258
And why should your songs be unfit for my halls?

874
01:32:06,055 --> 01:32:07,466
Come, sing me a song.

875
01:32:18,527 --> 01:32:21,859
Home is behind

876
01:32:22,028 --> 01:32:25,777
The world ahead

877
01:32:28,202 --> 01:32:34,037
And there are many paths to tread

878
01:32:35,833 --> 01:32:39,368
Through shadow

879
01:32:39,545 --> 01:32:43,709
To the edge of night

880
01:32:45,385 --> 01:32:50,462
Until the stars are all alight

881
01:32:53,476 --> 01:32:57,804
Mist and shadow

882
01:32:57,980 --> 01:33:02,273
Cloud and shade

883
01:33:04,653 --> 01:33:07,987
All shall fade

884
01:33:10,367 --> 01:33:14,364
All shall

885
01:33:20,127 --> 01:33:22,499
Fade

886
01:33:46,902 --> 01:33:50,353
March! March!

887
01:33:50,530 --> 01:33:55,738
March! March! March!

888
01:33:59,207 --> 01:34:01,532
Make way for the king.

889
01:34:03,043 --> 01:34:05,034
Make way.

890
01:34:07,504 --> 01:34:09,544
The king is here.

891
01:34:11,509 --> 01:34:13,134
My lord.

892
01:34:14,388 --> 01:34:16,344
Hail to you, sire.

893
01:34:16,807 --> 01:34:18,003
Grimbold, how many?

894
01:34:18,182 --> 01:34:20,637
I bring 500 men from the Westfold, my lord.

895
01:34:21,602 --> 01:34:24,271
We have 300 more from Fenmarch, Theoden King.

896
01:34:25,397 --> 01:34:29,347
- Where are the riders from Snowborn?
- None have come, my lord.

897
01:34:46,418 --> 01:34:48,541
Six thousand spears.

898
01:34:49,587 --> 01:34:51,580
Less than half of what I'd hoped for.

899
01:34:51,881 --> 01:34:55,250
Six thousand will not be enough
to break the lines of Mordor.

900
01:34:58,012 --> 01:34:59,755
More will come.

901
01:35:00,139 --> 01:35:03,092
Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.

902
01:35:03,266 --> 01:35:05,840
We have till dawn, then we must ride.

903
01:35:25,330 --> 01:35:27,655
The horses are restless...

904
01:35:27,833 --> 01:35:29,327
and the men are quiet.

905
01:35:29,793 --> 01:35:32,911
They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain.

906
01:35:35,381 --> 01:35:37,254
That road there...

907
01:35:38,175 --> 01:35:40,252
where does that lead?

908
01:35:41,012 --> 01:35:44,844
It is the road to the Dimholt,
the door under the mountain.

909
01:35:45,558 --> 01:35:48,558
None who venture there ever return.

910
01:35:49,769 --> 01:35:51,643
That mountain is evil.

911
01:36:14,586 --> 01:36:16,412
Aragorn.

912
01:36:17,171 --> 01:36:19,080
Let's find some food.

913
01:36:35,564 --> 01:36:36,975
There.

914
01:36:37,941 --> 01:36:40,942
A true esquire of Rohan.

915
01:36:44,573 --> 01:36:46,564
I'm ready.

916
01:36:48,159 --> 01:36:49,439
Sorry.

917
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:51,860
It isn't all that dangerous.

918
01:36:52,372 --> 01:36:54,697
It's not even sharp.

919
01:36:55,375 --> 01:36:58,791
Well, that's no good. You won't
kill many Orcs with a blunt blade.

920
01:36:58,962 --> 01:37:00,456
Come on.

921
01:37:04,632 --> 01:37:07,125
To the smithy. Go!

922
01:37:08,596 --> 01:37:11,134
You should not encourage him.

923
01:37:11,307 --> 01:37:13,762
You should not doubt him.

924
01:37:13,935 --> 01:37:17,219
I do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his arm.

925
01:37:19,940 --> 01:37:21,517
Why should Merry be left behind?

926
01:37:21,691 --> 01:37:24,313
He has as much cause to go to war as you.

927
01:37:26,488 --> 01:37:29,654
Why can he not fight for those he loves?

928
01:37:32,910 --> 01:37:35,911
You know as little of war as that Hobbit.

929
01:37:37,164 --> 01:37:39,240
When the fear takes him...

930
01:37:39,416 --> 01:37:44,459
and the blood and the screams and
the horror of battle take hold...

931
01:37:44,839 --> 01:37:46,996
do you think he would stand and fight?

932
01:37:49,551 --> 01:37:51,176
He would flee.

933
01:37:51,345 --> 01:37:53,384
And he would be right to do so.

934
01:37:55,599 --> 01:37:59,550
War is the province of Men, Eowyn.

935
01:38:35,220 --> 01:38:38,921
I choose a mortal life.

936
01:38:41,852 --> 01:38:44,721
I wish I could've seen him...

937
01:38:45,855 --> 01:38:48,560
one last time.

938
01:38:59,743 --> 01:39:01,154
Sir?

939
01:39:02,997 --> 01:39:05,570
King Theoden awaits you, my lord.

940
01:39:26,353 --> 01:39:28,310
I take my leave.

941
01:39:42,952 --> 01:39:44,197
My lord Elrond.

942
01:39:44,787 --> 01:39:48,286
I come on behalf of one whom I love.

943
01:39:51,376 --> 01:39:53,369
Arwen is dying.

944
01:39:58,174 --> 01:40:02,219
She will not long survive the
evil that now spreads from Mordor.

945
01:40:02,971 --> 01:40:06,340
The light of the Evenstar is failing.

946
01:40:06,516 --> 01:40:10,514
As Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes.

947
01:40:10,687 --> 01:40:14,434
Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the Ring.

948
01:40:15,190 --> 01:40:17,764
The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn.

949
01:40:18,153 --> 01:40:19,812
The end has come.

950
01:40:20,197 --> 01:40:22,817
It will not be our end, but his.

951
01:40:23,574 --> 01:40:27,157
You ride to war, but not to victory.

952
01:40:28,161 --> 01:40:31,826
Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith, this you know.

953
01:40:31,998 --> 01:40:36,412
But in secret he sends another force
which will attack from the river.

954
01:40:36,879 --> 01:40:40,295
A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the south.

955
01:40:40,925 --> 01:40:43,000
They'll be in the city in two days.

956
01:40:43,509 --> 01:40:46,344
You're outnumbered, Aragorn.

957
01:40:47,054 --> 01:40:49,178
You need more men.

958
01:40:49,557 --> 01:40:51,301
There are none.

959
01:40:53,061 --> 01:40:56,975
There are those who dwell in the mountain.

960
01:41:05,989 --> 01:41:08,148
Murderers...

961
01:41:08,325 --> 01:41:09,737
traitors.

962
01:41:12,205 --> 01:41:14,362
You would call upon them to fight?

963
01:41:14,539 --> 01:41:16,117
They believe in nothing.

964
01:41:16,291 --> 01:41:18,414
They answer to no one.

965
01:41:18,585 --> 01:41:21,669
They will answer to the king of Gondor.

966
01:41:28,803 --> 01:41:33,928
Anduril, the Flame of the West,
forged from the shards of Narsil.

967
01:41:48,239 --> 01:41:52,652
Sauron will not have forgotten the Sword of Elendil.

968
01:42:06,715 --> 01:42:11,460
The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith.

969
01:42:11,637 --> 01:42:14,043
The man who can wield the power of this sword...

970
01:42:14,221 --> 01:42:18,088
can summon to him an army more
deadly than any that walks this earth.

971
01:42:19,936 --> 01:42:22,094
Put aside the Ranger.

972
01:42:22,272 --> 01:42:25,605
Become who you were born to be.

973
01:42:25,775 --> 01:42:27,767
Take the Dimholt road.

974
01:42:31,702 --> 01:42:34,088
[Sindarin] <i>Ónen i-Estel Edain.</i>
[English] I gave hope to Men.

975
01:42:37,835 --> 01:42:38,935
[Sindarin] <i>Ú-chebin...</i>
[English] I have kept...

976
01:42:40,521 --> 01:42:41,736
[Sindarin] <i>...Estel anim.</i>
[English] ...no hope for me.

977
01:42:53,802 --> 01:42:55,463
Why are you doing this?

978
01:42:55,929 --> 01:42:59,131
The war lies to the east. You
cannot leave on the eve of battle.

979
01:43:01,559 --> 01:43:03,634
You cannot abandon the men.

980
01:43:04,937 --> 01:43:06,514
Eowyn...

981
01:43:06,688 --> 01:43:08,895
We need you here.

982
01:43:10,025 --> 01:43:11,899
Why have you come?

983
01:43:13,570 --> 01:43:15,527
Do you not know?

984
01:43:24,831 --> 01:43:27,832
It is but a shadow and a thought that you love.

985
01:43:31,754 --> 01:43:34,163
I cannot give you what you seek.

986
01:43:47,687 --> 01:43:51,601
I have wished you joy since first I saw you.

987
01:44:10,750 --> 01:44:13,038
Just where do you think you're off to?

988
01:44:13,210 --> 01:44:14,539
Not this time.

989
01:44:14,712 --> 01:44:16,918
This time you must stay, Gimli.

990
01:44:19,634 --> 01:44:22,469
Have you learned nothing of
the stubbornness of Dwarves?

991
01:44:22,638 --> 01:44:26,301
You might as well accept it.
We're going with you, laddie.

992
01:44:48,620 --> 01:44:50,778
- What's happening?
- Where is he going?

993
01:44:51,122 --> 01:44:52,996
Where's he going?

994
01:44:55,585 --> 01:44:57,624
I don't understand.

995
01:45:02,050 --> 01:45:03,841
Lord Aragorn!

996
01:45:04,260 --> 01:45:06,964
Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

997
01:45:08,181 --> 01:45:10,256
He leaves because there is no hope.

998
01:45:10,932 --> 01:45:13,056
He leaves because he must.

999
01:45:13,226 --> 01:45:14,935
Too few have come.

1000
01:45:15,104 --> 01:45:17,262
We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.

1001
01:45:19,775 --> 01:45:21,435
No...

1002
01:45:21,860 --> 01:45:23,105
we cannot.

1003
01:45:25,988 --> 01:45:29,773
But we will meet them in battle nonetheless.

1004
01:45:44,214 --> 01:45:45,958
I have left instruction.

1005
01:45:48,636 --> 01:45:51,886
The people are to follow your rule in my stead.

1006
01:45:58,478 --> 01:46:00,720
Take up my seat in the Golden Hall.

1007
01:46:01,982 --> 01:46:04,818
Long may you defend Edoras...

1008
01:46:04,986 --> 01:46:07,311
if the battle goes ill.

1009
01:46:08,405 --> 01:46:11,820
What other duty would you have me do, my lord?

1010
01:46:14,035 --> 01:46:15,992
Duty?

1011
01:46:18,164 --> 01:46:19,492
No.

1012
01:46:27,798 --> 01:46:29,921
I would have you smile again...

1013
01:46:33,345 --> 01:46:38,340
not grieve for those whose time has come.

1014
01:46:43,188 --> 01:46:46,687
You shall live to see these days renewed...

1015
01:46:51,029 --> 01:46:53,779
and no more despair.

1016
01:46:59,996 --> 01:47:03,696
What kind of army would linger in such a place?

1017
01:47:03,875 --> 01:47:05,702
One that is cursed.

1018
01:47:07,671 --> 01:47:10,207
Long ago, the Men of the Mountains swore an oath...

1019
01:47:10,630 --> 01:47:13,382
to the last king of Gondor...

1020
01:47:13,968 --> 01:47:15,545
to come to his aid...

1021
01:47:15,719 --> 01:47:17,427
to fight.

1022
01:47:17,930 --> 01:47:20,088
But when the time came...

1023
01:47:20,725 --> 01:47:23,344
when Gondor's need was dire...

1024
01:47:23,517 --> 01:47:25,391
they fled...

1025
01:47:25,561 --> 01:47:28,931
vanishing into the darkness of the mountain.

1026
01:47:29,982 --> 01:47:32,308
And so Isildur cursed them...

1027
01:47:33,862 --> 01:47:37,729
never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge.

1028
01:47:42,036 --> 01:47:45,202
Who shall call them from the grey twilight?

1029
01:47:45,664 --> 01:47:47,906
The forgotten people.

1030
01:47:48,083 --> 01:47:50,575
The heir of him to whom the oath they swore.

1031
01:47:51,046 --> 01:47:52,918
From the north shall he come.

1032
01:47:53,422 --> 01:47:55,081
Need shall drive him.

1033
01:47:56,175 --> 01:47:59,673
He shall pass the door to the Paths of the Dead.

1034
01:48:18,154 --> 01:48:21,440
The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.

1035
01:48:26,996 --> 01:48:28,953
The way is shut.

1036
01:48:29,707 --> 01:48:31,664
It was made by those who are dead.

1037
01:48:32,292 --> 01:48:34,534
And the Dead keep it.

1038
01:48:35,087 --> 01:48:36,629
The way is shut.

1039
01:48:47,975 --> 01:48:49,469
Brego!

1040
01:48:52,979 --> 01:48:55,683
I do not fear death.

1041
01:49:07,993 --> 01:49:10,401
Well, this is a thing unheard-of.

1042
01:49:10,579 --> 01:49:15,241
An Elf will go underground where a Dwarf dare not?

1043
01:49:15,418 --> 01:49:16,746
Oh.

1044
01:49:16,919 --> 01:49:19,754
Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.

1045
01:49:34,770 --> 01:49:37,011
We must ride light and swift.

1046
01:49:37,188 --> 01:49:38,931
It is a long road ahead.

1047
01:49:39,106 --> 01:49:42,191
And man and beast must reach the
end with the strength to fight.

1048
01:49:47,698 --> 01:49:50,700
Little Hobbits do not belong in war, Master Meriadoc.

1049
01:49:51,035 --> 01:49:53,027
All my friends have gone to battle.

1050
01:49:53,203 --> 01:49:55,077
I would be ashamed to be left behind.

1051
01:49:55,247 --> 01:49:57,370
It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith.

1052
01:49:57,541 --> 01:49:59,913
And none of my riders can bear you as a burden.

1053
01:50:00,919 --> 01:50:03,042
I want to fight.

1054
01:50:03,547 --> 01:50:05,539
I will say no more.

1055
01:50:22,356 --> 01:50:24,313
Ride with me.

1056
01:50:25,777 --> 01:50:27,187
My lady.

1057
01:50:27,361 --> 01:50:29,733
Form up! Move out!

1058
01:50:29,906 --> 01:50:33,109
Form up! Move out!

1059
01:50:36,202 --> 01:50:37,400
Ride!

1060
01:50:37,579 --> 01:50:40,533
Ride now to Gondor!

1061
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:51,360
[Black Speech] <i> Katmuda! </i>
[English]  Death to men!

1062
01:50:52,884 --> 01:50:54,184
[Black Speech] <i> Katmuda! </i>
[English]  Death to men!

1063
01:50:54,185 --> 01:50:54,785
[Black Speech] <i> Gorosh! </i>
[English]  Louder!

1064
01:50:54,786 --> 01:50:56,086
[Black Speech] <i> Katmuda! </i>
[English]  Death to men!

1065
01:50:56,087 --> 01:50:56,587
[Black Speech] <i> Gorosh! </i>
[English]  Louder!

1066
01:50:56,588 --> 01:50:57,888
[Black Speech] <i> Katmuda! </i>
[English]  Death to men!

1067
01:50:57,889 --> 01:50:59,389
[Black Speech] <i> Gorosh chadar! </i>
[English]  Loud enough!

1068
01:51:22,164 --> 01:51:23,907
What is it?

1069
01:51:24,082 --> 01:51:25,624
What do you see?

1070
01:51:25,875 --> 01:51:27,998
I see shapes of men.

1071
01:51:30,672 --> 01:51:32,047
And of horses.

1072
01:51:32,799 --> 01:51:33,997
Where?

1073
01:51:34,175 --> 01:51:37,129
Pale banners like shreds of cloud.

1074
01:51:39,556 --> 01:51:41,761
Spears rise...

1075
01:51:42,391 --> 01:51:45,843
like winter-thickets through a shroud of mist.

1076
01:51:47,104 --> 01:51:49,262
The Dead are following.

1077
01:51:50,482 --> 01:51:51,977
They have been summoned.

1078
01:51:52,652 --> 01:51:54,478
The Dead?

1079
01:51:54,862 --> 01:51:56,570
Summoned?

1080
01:51:56,989 --> 01:51:58,863
I knew that.

1081
01:52:02,202 --> 01:52:03,946
Very good.

1082
01:52:04,663 --> 01:52:06,738
Very good! Legolas!

1083
01:52:44,702 --> 01:52:46,112
Do not look down.

1084
01:53:38,712 --> 01:53:43,837
Who enters my domain?

1085
01:53:47,596 --> 01:53:49,800
One who will have your allegiance.

1086
01:53:52,765 --> 01:53:58,105
The Dead do not suffer the living to pass.

1087
01:53:58,439 --> 01:54:01,108
You will suffer me.

1088
01:54:24,629 --> 01:54:28,000
The way is shut.

1089
01:54:29,177 --> 01:54:33,636
It was made by those who are dead.

1090
01:54:34,014 --> 01:54:38,177
And the Dead keep it.

1091
01:54:47,319 --> 01:54:50,403
The way is shut.

1092
01:54:52,157 --> 01:54:54,778
Now you must die.

1093
01:54:58,663 --> 01:55:01,498
I summon you to fulfill your oath.

1094
01:55:01,833 --> 01:55:06,790
None but the king of Gondor may command me.

1095
01:55:12,385 --> 01:55:14,542
That line was broken.

1096
01:55:17,181 --> 01:55:19,386
It has been remade.

1097
01:55:27,315 --> 01:55:28,858
Fight for us...

1098
01:55:29,026 --> 01:55:31,564
and regain your honor.

1099
01:55:35,739 --> 01:55:37,068
What say you?

1100
01:55:49,294 --> 01:55:50,836
What say you?

1101
01:55:51,588 --> 01:55:53,380
You waste your time, Aragorn.

1102
01:55:53,549 --> 01:55:56,716
They had no honor in life, they have none now in death.

1103
01:55:57,220 --> 01:55:59,711
I am Isildur's heir.

1104
01:56:00,265 --> 01:56:02,220
Fight for me...

1105
01:56:02,807 --> 01:56:06,390
and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.

1106
01:56:10,315 --> 01:56:12,273
What say you?

1107
01:56:20,199 --> 01:56:22,406
You have my word!

1108
01:56:22,701 --> 01:56:26,700
Fight, and I will release you from this living death!

1109
01:56:28,166 --> 01:56:29,661
What say you?!

1110
01:56:32,962 --> 01:56:35,916
Stand, you traitors!

1111
01:57:02,864 --> 01:57:03,896
Out!

1112
01:57:25,262 --> 01:57:26,840
Legolas!

1113
01:57:27,974 --> 01:57:29,171
Run!

1114
01:58:35,496 --> 01:58:37,571
We fight.

1115
01:58:47,924 --> 01:58:50,498
Open the gate! Quick!

1116
01:59:21,540 --> 01:59:23,533
Quick! Hurry!

1117
01:59:37,304 --> 01:59:38,929
Faramir!

1118
01:59:39,933 --> 01:59:43,183
Say not that he has fallen.

1119
01:59:44,354 --> 01:59:45,896
They were outnumbered.

1120
01:59:46,313 --> 01:59:47,891
None survived.

1121
01:59:48,607 --> 01:59:50,600
Fear.

1122
01:59:51,152 --> 01:59:54,355
The city is rank with it.

1123
01:59:56,699 --> 01:59:59,154
Let us ease their pain.

1124
01:59:59,410 --> 02:00:01,153
Release the prisoners.

1125
02:00:01,328 --> 02:00:03,286
Catapults!

1126
02:00:16,634 --> 02:00:20,086
My sons are spent.

1127
02:00:21,139 --> 02:00:24,056
My line has ended.

1128
02:00:26,895 --> 02:00:28,306
He's alive!

1129
02:00:28,479 --> 02:00:31,645
The House of Stewards has failed.

1130
02:00:31,815 --> 02:00:33,274
He needs medicine, my lord.

1131
02:00:34,319 --> 02:00:36,987
My line has ended!

1132
02:00:38,489 --> 02:00:40,482
My lord!

1133
02:00:54,005 --> 02:00:55,831
Rohan...

1134
02:00:56,590 --> 02:00:58,996
has deserted us.

1135
02:01:13,438 --> 02:01:16,641
Theoden's betrayed me.

1136
02:01:27,787 --> 02:01:29,613
Abandon your posts!

1137
02:01:30,664 --> 02:01:34,578
Flee! Flee for your lives!

1138
02:01:44,719 --> 02:01:46,261
Prepare for battle!

1139
02:01:46,804 --> 02:01:49,970
Hurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall!

1140
02:01:51,142 --> 02:01:53,099
Over here!

1141
02:01:53,853 --> 02:01:56,225
Return to your posts!

1142
02:02:07,032 --> 02:02:09,653
Send these foul beasts into the abyss.

1143
02:02:19,836 --> 02:02:21,295
Stay where you are.

1144
02:02:38,270 --> 02:02:39,681
We need more rubble!

1145
02:02:39,855 --> 02:02:41,729
Watch out!

1146
02:02:41,899 --> 02:02:44,436
Down to the lower levels. Quick!

1147
02:02:46,319 --> 02:02:47,861
Double up, men!

1148
02:03:56,845 --> 02:03:59,846
Hold them back! Do not give in to fear.

1149
02:04:00,349 --> 02:04:03,848
Stand to your posts! Fight!

1150
02:04:44,516 --> 02:04:46,140
Not at the towers!

1151
02:04:46,309 --> 02:04:49,310
Aim for the trolls! Kill the trolls!

1152
02:04:50,063 --> 02:04:51,890
Bring them down!

1153
02:05:27,014 --> 02:05:29,055
Fight them back!

1154
02:05:29,226 --> 02:05:31,219
Peregrin Took!

1155
02:05:32,104 --> 02:05:35,270
- Go back to the Citadel!
- They'd called us out to fight.

1156
02:05:50,956 --> 02:05:53,328
This is no place for a Hobbit.

1157
02:06:19,065 --> 02:06:20,525
Guard of the Citadel, indeed.

1158
02:06:21,152 --> 02:06:24,484
Now, back, up the hill. Quickly. Quick!

1159
02:06:35,831 --> 02:06:38,786
What are you doing, you useless scum?!

1160
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:40,917
The door won't give. It's too strong.

1161
02:06:47,259 --> 02:06:49,666
Get back there and smash it down.

1162
02:06:49,844 --> 02:06:51,837
But nothing can breach it.

1163
02:06:54,765 --> 02:06:57,008
Grond will breach it.

1164
02:07:00,438 --> 02:07:02,514
Bring up the wolf's head.

1165
02:07:05,693 --> 02:07:11,031
Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!

1166
02:07:11,365 --> 02:07:15,198
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1167
02:07:17,121 --> 02:07:20,537
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1168
02:07:21,250 --> 02:07:24,914
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1169
02:07:25,336 --> 02:07:29,500
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1170
02:07:29,675 --> 02:07:33,376
Grond! Grond! Grond!
