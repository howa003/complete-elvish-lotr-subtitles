2
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,535
[Sindarin] <i>Anirne hene beriad i chên lîn.</i>
[English] She wanted to protect her child.

3
00:00:38,454 --> 00:00:42,249
[Sindarin] <i>Ned Imladris nauthant e le beriathar aen.</i>
[English] She thought in Rivendell you would be safe.

4
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:48,512
In her heart, your mother knew
you'd be hunted all your life.

5
00:00:49,112 --> 00:00:50,812
That you'd never escape your fate.

6
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:54,712
The skill of the elves can reforge
the sword of kings...

7
00:00:55,412 --> 00:00:59,113
...but only you have the power to wield it.

8
00:01:00,313 --> 00:01:02,713
I do not want that power.

9
00:01:03,013 --> 00:01:05,613
I have never wanted it.

10
00:01:06,914 --> 00:01:09,414
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

11
00:01:14,114 --> 00:01:16,314
My old sword! Sting.

12
00:01:16,714 --> 00:01:17,815
Here, take it. Take it.

13
00:01:23,215 --> 00:01:27,015
- It's so light.
- Yes, yeah. Made by the elves, you know.

14
00:01:27,815 --> 00:01:31,816
The blade glows blue when orcs are close.

15
00:01:32,316 --> 00:01:36,716
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

16
00:01:37,016 --> 00:01:39,416
Here's a pretty thing.

17
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:41,117
Mithril.

18
00:01:42,017 --> 00:01:46,217
As light as a feather, and as hard as dragon scales.

19
00:01:46,617 --> 00:01:49,717
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

20
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,918
My old ring.

21
00:02:01,218 --> 00:02:05,019
I should very much like...

22
00:02:05,419 --> 00:02:09,219
...to hold it again, one last time.

23
00:02:26,721 --> 00:02:30,221
I'm sorry I brought this upon you, my boy.

24
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:34,622
I'm sorry that you must carry this burden.

25
00:02:39,422 --> 00:02:42,322
I'm sorry for everything.

26
00:02:57,324 --> 00:03:01,524
The ring-bearer is setting out
on the quest of Mount Doom.

27
00:03:02,924 --> 00:03:05,424
On you who travel with him, no oath...

28
00:03:05,824 --> 00:03:08,825
...nor bond is laid to go further than you will.

29
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,725
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

30
00:03:15,225 --> 00:03:19,026
May the blessings of elves and men...

31
00:03:19,826 --> 00:03:22,326
...and all free folk go with you.

32
00:03:25,426 --> 00:03:29,327
The fellowship awaits the ring-bearer.

33
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:50,429
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

34
00:03:51,029 --> 00:03:52,829
Left.

35
00:05:12,536 --> 00:05:16,636
We must hold to this course, west
of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.

36
00:05:17,137 --> 00:05:20,637
If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.

37
00:05:21,137 --> 00:05:24,637
From there, our road turns east to Mordor.

38
00:05:24,637 --> 00:05:28,538
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

39
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,538
Move your feet.

40
00:05:31,538 --> 00:05:33,038
- You look good, Pippin.
- Thanks.

41
00:05:33,338 --> 00:05:34,738
Faster!

42
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:39,739
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

43
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:42,639
...I'd say we were taking the long way 'round.

44
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:46,239
Gandalf.
We could pass through the mines of Moria.

45
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:50,640
My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.

46
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,240
No Gimli, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

47
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:06,841
Sorry!

48
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,041
Get him!

49
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,842
- For the Shire!
- Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

50
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:15,742
Gentlemen, that's enough.

51
00:06:19,642 --> 00:06:21,142
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

52
00:06:21,642 --> 00:06:24,243
- What is that?
- Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

53
00:06:24,643 --> 00:06:27,143
It's moving fast.

54
00:06:27,543 --> 00:06:29,643
Against the wind.

55
00:06:30,443 --> 00:06:32,543
- Crebain from Dunland!
- Hide!

56
00:06:32,843 --> 00:06:35,444
- Hurry!
- Take cover!

57
00:07:09,047 --> 00:07:10,647
Spies of Saruman.

58
00:07:11,447 --> 00:07:14,547
The passage south is being watched.

59
00:07:15,847 --> 00:07:19,148
We must take the pass of Caradhras.

60
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:33,349
Frodo!

61
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:54,651
Boromir.

62
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:59,151
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

63
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:02,352
...over so small a thing.

64
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,652
Such a little thing.

65
00:08:07,952 --> 00:08:09,352
Boromir!

66
00:08:10,052 --> 00:08:12,553
Give the ring to Frodo.

67
00:08:22,554 --> 00:08:24,454
As you wish.

68
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,254
I care not.

69
00:09:02,657 --> 00:09:07,158
So, Gandalf, you try to lead them over Caradhras.

70
00:09:07,558 --> 00:09:12,058
And if that fails, where then will you go?

71
00:09:13,558 --> 00:09:16,359
If the mountain defeats you...

72
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:20,959
... will you risk a more dangerous road?

73
00:09:28,473 --> 00:09:32,642
[Quenya] <i>Cuiva nwalca Carnirassë!</i>
[English] Wake up cruel Redhorn!

74
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,260
There is a fell voice on the air.

75
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,961
It's Saruman!

76
00:09:47,961 --> 00:09:52,362
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

77
00:09:52,762 --> 00:09:54,562
No!

78
00:09:56,672 --> 00:10:00,453
[Sindarin] <i>Losto Caradhras, Sedho! Hodo!</i>
[English] Sleep Redhorn, Be still! Lie Still!

79
00:10:00,973 --> 00:10:02,523
[Sindarin] <i>Nuitho i 'Ruith!</i>
[English] Hold your Wrath!

80
00:10:02,973 --> 00:10:08,003
[Quenya] <i>Cuiva nwalca Carnirassë!</i>
[English] Wake up cruel Redhorn!

81
00:10:08,673 --> 00:10:11,334
[Quenya] <i>Nai yarvaxëa rasselya...</i>
[English] May your bloodstained horn...

82
00:10:12,174 --> 00:10:15,474
[Quenya] <i>...taltuva ñotto-carinnar!</i>
[English] ...fall upon enemy heads!

83
00:11:01,068 --> 00:11:02,868
We must get off the mountain!

84
00:11:03,368 --> 00:11:07,569
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

85
00:11:07,969 --> 00:11:11,169
The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard!

86
00:11:11,469 --> 00:11:15,069
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

87
00:11:15,469 --> 00:11:18,170
Let us go through the mines of Moria.

88
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:23,670
Moria. You fear to go into those mines.

89
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:29,371
The dwarves delved too greedily and too deep.

90
00:11:30,471 --> 00:11:35,171
You know what they awoke
in the darkness of Khazad-dûm:

91
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:39,872
Shadow and flame.

92
00:11:43,472 --> 00:11:46,072
Let the ring-bearer decide.

93
00:11:50,873 --> 00:11:52,973
We cannot stay here!

94
00:11:52,973 --> 00:11:55,873
This will be the death of the hobbits.

95
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,773
Frodo?

96
00:12:00,874 --> 00:12:03,574
We will go through the mines.

97
00:12:04,574 --> 00:12:06,374
So be it.

98
00:12:13,075 --> 00:12:16,775
Frodo, come and help an old man.

99
00:12:20,475 --> 00:12:22,576
How is your shoulder?

100
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:25,976
- Better than it was.
- And the ring?

101
00:12:27,676 --> 00:12:30,176
You feel its power growing, don't you?

102
00:12:30,676 --> 00:12:33,477
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

103
00:12:34,077 --> 00:12:37,777
Evil will be drawn to you from
outside the fellowship.

104
00:12:38,077 --> 00:12:40,577
And, I fear, from within.

105
00:12:43,378 --> 00:12:47,378
- Who then do I trust?
- You must trust yourself.

106
00:12:47,678 --> 00:12:50,378
Trust your own strengths.

107
00:12:50,778 --> 00:12:53,278
- What do you mean?
- There are many powers in this world...

108
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:55,479
...for good or for evil.

109
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:57,979
Some are greater than I am.

110
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:01,979
And against some I have not yet been tested.

111
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:04,880
The walls...

112
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,680
...of Moria.

113
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,381
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

114
00:13:16,681 --> 00:13:20,881
Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

115
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:23,881
Why doesn't that surprise me?

116
00:13:31,882 --> 00:13:35,082
Well, let's see.

117
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:36,882
Ithildin.

118
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,783
It mirrors only starlight and moonlight.

119
00:13:54,984 --> 00:13:59,385
It reads; "The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria.

120
00:13:59,685 --> 00:14:04,385
- Speak, friend, and enter."
- What do you suppose that means?

121
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:09,085
Oh It's quite simple. If you are a friend,
you speak the password and the doors will open.

122
00:14:09,171 --> 00:14:13,834
[Sindarin] <i>Annon Edhellen edro hi ammen!</i>
[English] Gate of the elves, open now for me!

123
00:14:21,757 --> 00:14:28,157
[Sindarin] <i>Fennas Nogothrim, lasto beth lammen.</i>
[English] Doorway of the Dwarf-folk, listen to the word of my tongue.

124
00:14:32,988 --> 00:14:33,988
Nothing's happening.

125
00:14:41,188 --> 00:14:45,189
I once knew every spell in
all the tongues of elves...

126
00:14:45,689 --> 00:14:48,389
...men and orcs.

127
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:49,889
What are you going to do, then?

128
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,289
Knock your head against these doors,
Peregrin Took!

129
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:54,490
And if that does not shatter them...

130
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,390
...and I am allowed a little
peace from foolish questions...

131
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,990
...I will try to find the opening words.

132
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,401
[Quenya] <i>Ando Eldarinwa...</i>
[English] Gate of elves...

133
00:15:07,901 --> 00:15:09,901
[Quenya] <i>...a lasta quettanya...</i>
[English] ...listen to my word...

134
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,001
[Quenya] <i>...fenda casarinwa!</i>
[English] ...threshold of dwarves!

135
00:15:13,991 --> 00:15:16,392
Mines are no place for a pony.

136
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:20,592
- Even one so brave as Bill.
- Bye-bye, Bill.

137
00:15:20,592 --> 00:15:21,992
Fennas Nogothrim...
(Doorway of the dwarf-folk...)

138
00:15:21,992 --> 00:15:24,692
Go on, Bill. Go on.

139
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:28,893
Don't worry, Sam, he knows the way home.

140
00:15:35,793 --> 00:15:38,194
Do not disturb the water.

141
00:15:38,494 --> 00:15:40,394
Oh, it's useless.

142
00:15:53,095 --> 00:15:55,195
It's a riddle.

143
00:15:57,995 --> 00:16:01,096
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

144
00:16:01,596 --> 00:16:04,396
What's the elvish word for "friend"?

145
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,633
[Sindarin] Mellon.
[English] Friend.

146
00:16:05,796 --> 00:16:07,096
Mellon.

147
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,898
Soon, master elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the dwarves.

148
00:16:30,498 --> 00:16:35,999
Roaring fires, malt beer, ripe meat off the bone!

149
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:40,699
This, my friend, is the home of my cousin Balin.

150
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:43,600
And they call it a mine.

151
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,700
A mine!

152
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,000
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

153
00:16:56,301 --> 00:16:57,801
No....

154
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,701
No!

155
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:04,902
Goblins.

156
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:13,002
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

157
00:17:14,202 --> 00:17:16,703
Now, get out of here. Get out!

158
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:21,903
- Frodo!
- Help!

159
00:17:22,303 --> 00:17:23,803
Strider!

160
00:17:23,803 --> 00:17:26,604
- Help!
- Get off him!

161
00:17:26,904 --> 00:17:27,904
Aragorn!

162
00:17:38,405 --> 00:17:39,405
Frodo!

163
00:18:05,707 --> 00:18:06,807
Into the mines!

164
00:18:06,807 --> 00:18:10,108
- Legolas!
- Into the cave!

165
00:18:14,508 --> 00:18:16,208
Run!

166
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,710
We now have but one choice.

167
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:41,610
We must face the long dark of Moria.

168
00:18:42,111 --> 00:18:44,011
Be on your guard.

169
00:18:44,311 --> 00:18:47,611
There are older and fouler things than orcs...

170
00:18:48,011 --> 00:18:51,311
...in the deep places of the world.

171
00:18:59,412 --> 00:19:03,112
Quietly now.
It's a four-day journey to the other side.

172
00:19:03,613 --> 00:19:07,213
Let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed.

173
00:19:53,117 --> 00:19:56,717
The wealth of Moria was not in gold...

174
00:19:57,117 --> 00:19:59,418
...or jewels...

175
00:19:59,418 --> 00:20:02,618
...but mithril.

176
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,720
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

177
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,020
- Oh, that was a kingly gift.
- Yes.

178
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,121
I never told him...

179
00:20:32,421 --> 00:20:37,121
...but its worth was greater
than the value of the Shire.

180
00:20:49,622 --> 00:20:51,322
Pippin.

181
00:21:11,724 --> 00:21:14,525
I have no memory of this place.

182
00:21:16,725 --> 00:21:18,125
- Are we Lost?
- No.

183
00:21:18,425 --> 00:21:20,825
- I think we are.
- Gandalf's thinking.

184
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,525
- Merry?
- What?

185
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:24,625
I'm hungry.

186
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:40,327
- There's something down there.
- It's Gollum.

187
00:21:40,727 --> 00:21:44,627
- Gollum?
- He's been following us for three days.

188
00:21:45,127 --> 00:21:49,128
- He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?
- Escaped...

189
00:21:49,928 --> 00:21:51,528
...or was set loose.

190
00:21:52,128 --> 00:21:55,628
Now the ring has brought him here.

191
00:21:58,329 --> 00:22:01,029
He will never be rid of his need for it.

192
00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:06,829
He hates and loves the ring,
as he hates and loves himseIf.

193
00:22:07,229 --> 00:22:11,930
Smeagol's life is a sad story.

194
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:18,030
Yes, Smeagol he was once called.
Before the ring found him.

195
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:21,931
Before it drove him mad.

196
00:22:22,231 --> 00:22:25,031
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

197
00:22:25,331 --> 00:22:26,431
Pity?

198
00:22:27,531 --> 00:22:30,432
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

199
00:22:31,432 --> 00:22:36,432
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

200
00:22:38,132 --> 00:22:40,532
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

201
00:22:43,033 --> 00:22:46,833
Do not be too eager to deal
out death and judgment.

202
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:49,933
Even the very wise cannot see all ends.

203
00:22:50,633 --> 00:22:56,334
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

204
00:22:57,434 --> 00:23:00,134
...before this is over.

205
00:23:01,734 --> 00:23:05,435
The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.

206
00:23:12,335 --> 00:23:15,536
I wish the ring had never come to me.

207
00:23:17,036 --> 00:23:19,036
I wish none of this had happened.

208
00:23:19,036 --> 00:23:24,036
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

209
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:30,437
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

210
00:23:32,137 --> 00:23:35,938
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

211
00:23:36,538 --> 00:23:38,938
Bilbo was meant to find the ring.

212
00:23:39,438 --> 00:23:43,638
In which case, you also were meant to have it.

213
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:47,039
And that is an encouraging thought.

214
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:53,939
It's that way.

215
00:23:54,239 --> 00:23:56,439
- He's remembered.
- No.

216
00:23:56,739 --> 00:24:00,340
But the air doesn't smell so foul down here.

217
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,640
If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose.

218
00:24:20,742 --> 00:24:24,742
Let me risk a little more light.

219
00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:31,543
Behold...

220
00:24:32,043 --> 00:24:37,143
...the great realm and dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

221
00:24:39,743 --> 00:24:43,044
Now there's an eye opener, and no mistake.

222
00:25:08,146 --> 00:25:09,846
Gimli!

223
00:25:17,247 --> 00:25:18,847
No!

224
00:25:21,447 --> 00:25:24,548
Oh, no.

225
00:25:26,448 --> 00:25:27,648
No.

226
00:25:35,048 --> 00:25:36,949
"Here lies Balin...

227
00:25:37,449 --> 00:25:39,449
...son of Fundin...

228
00:25:39,849 --> 00:25:42,349
...Lord of Moria."

229
00:25:43,449 --> 00:25:45,049
He is dead, then.

230
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,550
It's as I feared.

231
00:26:06,851 --> 00:26:09,652
We must move on. We cannot linger.

232
00:26:09,952 --> 00:26:14,452
"They have taken the bridge and the second hall.

233
00:26:15,752 --> 00:26:18,252
We have barred the gates...

234
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:21,353
...but cannot hold them for long.

235
00:26:21,653 --> 00:26:24,353
The ground shakes.

236
00:26:24,953 --> 00:26:26,353
Drums...

237
00:26:26,853 --> 00:26:30,054
...drums in the deep.

238
00:26:33,854 --> 00:26:35,754
We cannot get out.

239
00:26:37,854 --> 00:26:41,555
A shadow moves in the dark.

240
00:26:43,355 --> 00:26:45,855
We cannot get out.

241
00:26:48,955 --> 00:26:50,755
They are coming."

242
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:35,760
Fool of a Took!

243
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,760
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

244
00:28:05,962 --> 00:28:07,563
Frodo!

245
00:28:09,963 --> 00:28:11,363
Orcs.

246
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:20,364
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

247
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,365
They have a cave-troll.

248
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:46,366
Let them come!

249
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:50,166
There is one dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

250
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,979
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

251
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,480
Frodo!

252
00:31:51,983 --> 00:31:53,783
Aragorn! Aragorn!

253
00:31:54,883 --> 00:31:56,684
Frodo!

254
00:32:41,888 --> 00:32:43,788
Frodo!

255
00:33:44,093 --> 00:33:45,394
Oh, no.

256
00:33:53,794 --> 00:33:55,595
He's alive.

257
00:33:58,195 --> 00:34:00,995
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

258
00:34:01,295 --> 00:34:03,395
You should be dead.

259
00:34:03,795 --> 00:34:06,095
That spear would have skewered a wild boar.

260
00:34:06,396 --> 00:34:10,996
I think there's more to this
hobbit than meets the eye.

261
00:34:16,996 --> 00:34:18,097
Mithril.

262
00:34:20,897 --> 00:34:23,397
You are full of surprises, Master Baggins.

263
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:31,198
To the bridge of Khazad-dûm!

264
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:47,999
This way!

265
00:35:58,506 --> 00:36:01,306
What is this new devilry?

266
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,308
A Balrog.

267
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:23,708
A demon of the ancient world.

268
00:36:26,008 --> 00:36:28,309
This foe is beyond any of you.

269
00:36:29,609 --> 00:36:31,109
Run!

270
00:36:38,409 --> 00:36:39,910
Quickly!

271
00:36:56,611 --> 00:36:57,911
Gandalf.

272
00:36:58,511 --> 00:37:00,011
Lead them on, Aragorn.

273
00:37:01,512 --> 00:37:04,012
The bridge is near.

274
00:37:06,012 --> 00:37:10,012
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

275
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,915
Gandalf!

276
00:37:59,317 --> 00:38:00,517
Merry! Pippin!

277
00:38:11,718 --> 00:38:13,118
Sam!

278
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:19,019
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

279
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:23,619
Not the beard!

280
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,821
Steady.

281
00:38:40,821 --> 00:38:42,421
Hold on!

282
00:39:03,623 --> 00:39:04,823
Hang on!

283
00:39:15,524 --> 00:39:17,224
Lean forward!

284
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:21,224
Steady.

285
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:23,725
Come on!

286
00:39:24,025 --> 00:39:25,425
Now!

287
00:39:42,626 --> 00:39:44,327
Over the bridge!

288
00:39:44,627 --> 00:39:46,127
Fly!

289
00:40:30,831 --> 00:40:32,831
You cannot pass!

290
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:34,731
Gandalf!

291
00:40:39,032 --> 00:40:43,732
I am a servant of the secret fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

292
00:40:44,832 --> 00:40:48,532
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!

293
00:40:58,733 --> 00:41:00,634
Go back to the Shadow.

294
00:41:08,534 --> 00:41:12,735
YOU - SHALL NOT - PASS!

295
00:41:40,037 --> 00:41:43,738
- No! No!
- Gandalf!

296
00:41:51,538 --> 00:41:53,939
Fly, you fools!

297
00:41:58,139 --> 00:42:00,239
No!

298
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,540
Aragorn!

299
00:43:06,045 --> 00:43:08,745
Legolas, get them up.

300
00:43:12,846 --> 00:43:14,646
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

301
00:43:14,946 --> 00:43:18,446
By nightfall, these hills will be swarming with orcs.

302
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:21,947
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.

303
00:43:23,047 --> 00:43:26,247
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

304
00:43:27,947 --> 00:43:30,047
On your feet, Sam.

305
00:43:30,447 --> 00:43:31,848
Frodo?

306
00:43:33,948 --> 00:43:35,548
Frodo!

307
00:44:28,153 --> 00:44:30,553
Stay close, young hobbits!

308
00:44:31,453 --> 00:44:35,453
They say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods.

309
00:44:35,753 --> 00:44:38,154
An elf-witch...

310
00:44:38,954 --> 00:44:41,654
...of terrible power.

311
00:44:42,354 --> 00:44:44,454
All who look upon her...

312
00:44:44,454 --> 00:44:46,454
...fall under her spell.

313
00:44:46,754 --> 00:44:47,955
<i>Frodo!</i>

314
00:44:50,255 --> 00:44:52,255
And are never seen again.

315
00:44:52,255 --> 00:44:56,755
<i>Your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom.</i>

316
00:44:57,155 --> 00:45:00,756
<i>You bring great evil here, ring-bearer.</i>

317
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,756
Mr. Frodo?

318
00:45:08,256 --> 00:45:13,657
Well, here's one dwarf she won't ensnare so easily.

319
00:45:13,957 --> 00:45:18,357
I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox.

320
00:45:26,158 --> 00:45:30,558
The dwarf breathes so loud, we
could have shot him in the dark.

321
00:45:34,805 --> 00:45:38,107
[Sindarin] <i>Mae govannen, Legolas Thranduilion.</i>
[English] Welcome, Legolas son of Thranduil.

322
00:45:38,482 --> 00:45:41,610
[Sindarin] <i>Govannas vîn gwennen le, Haldir o Lórien.</i>
[English] Our fellowship stands in your debt, Haldir of Lórien.

323
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:45,969
[Sindarin] <i>A Aragorn in Dúnedain...</i>
[English] Oh, Aragorn of the Dúnedain...

324
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:48,070
[Sindarin] <i>...istannen le ammen.</i>
[English] ...you are known to us.

325
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,360
Haldir.

326
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,060
So much for the legendary courtesy of the elves!

327
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,261
Speak words we can all understand!

328
00:45:53,261 --> 00:45:57,861
We have not had dealings with
the dwarves since the dark days.

329
00:45:58,261 --> 00:46:00,661
And you know what this dwarf says to that?

330
00:46:01,061 --> 00:46:05,662
Ishkhaqwi ai durugnul!
(I spit upon your grave!)

331
00:46:07,662 --> 00:46:09,562
That was not so courteous.

332
00:46:16,163 --> 00:46:20,063
You bring great evil with you.

333
00:46:22,063 --> 00:46:24,163
You can go no further.

334
00:46:29,774 --> 00:46:32,544
[Sindarin] <i>Boe ammen veriad lîn. Andelu i ven!</i>
[English] We need your protection. The road is too dangerous!

335
00:46:35,574 --> 00:46:36,975
[Sindarin] <i>Merin le telim.</i>
[English] I wish we may come with you.

336
00:46:38,175 --> 00:46:39,875
[Sindarin] <i>Boe ammen i dulu lîn!</i>
[English] We need your support!

337
00:46:41,065 --> 00:46:43,865
Aragorn!

338
00:46:54,276 --> 00:46:55,876
[Sindarin] <i>Merin le telim.</i>
[English] I wish we may come with you.

339
00:46:58,617 --> 00:47:00,217
[Sindarin] <i>Andelu i ven!</i>
[English] The road is too dangerous!

340
00:47:01,567 --> 00:47:04,067
Gandalf's death was not in vain.

341
00:47:05,367 --> 00:47:07,167
Nor would he have you give up hope.

342
00:47:08,767 --> 00:47:11,968
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

343
00:47:13,068 --> 00:47:16,068
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

344
00:47:18,968 --> 00:47:20,969
You will follow me.

345
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:34,670
Caras Galadhon.

346
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:38,170
The heart of Elvendom on earth.

347
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:43,871
Realm of the Lord Celeborn
and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.

348
00:49:03,278 --> 00:49:06,178
The enemy knows you have entered here.

349
00:49:06,978 --> 00:49:11,879
What hope you had in secrecy is now gone.

350
00:49:13,879 --> 00:49:18,079
Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from Rivendell.

351
00:49:18,579 --> 00:49:20,380
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

352
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:23,580
For I much desire to speak with him.

353
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,480
I can no longer see him from afar.

354
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:32,481
Gandalf the Grey did not pass
the borders of this land.

355
00:49:32,981 --> 00:49:35,281
He has fallen into shadow.

356
00:49:40,081 --> 00:49:44,382
He was taken by both shadow and flame.

357
00:49:46,282 --> 00:49:49,782
A Balrog of Morgoth.

358
00:49:50,682 --> 00:49:53,983
For we went needlessly into the net of Moria.

359
00:49:56,183 --> 00:49:59,283
Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life.

360
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:03,283
We do not yet know his full purpose.

361
00:50:08,084 --> 00:50:12,184
Do not let the great emptiness
of Khazad-dûm fill your heart...

362
00:50:12,584 --> 00:50:14,785
...Gimli, son of Gloin.

363
00:50:15,885 --> 00:50:19,285
For the world has grown full of peril...

364
00:50:20,885 --> 00:50:23,485
...and in all lands...

365
00:50:23,785 --> 00:50:27,186
...love is now mingled with grief.

366
00:50:39,887 --> 00:50:42,587
What now becomes of this fellowship?

367
00:50:43,287 --> 00:50:46,087
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

368
00:50:49,188 --> 00:50:52,388
The quest stands upon the edge of a knife.

369
00:50:52,388 --> 00:50:55,488
Stray but a little and it will fail...

370
00:50:56,488 --> 00:50:59,189
...to the ruin of all.

371
00:51:03,689 --> 00:51:09,190
Yet hope remains while the company is true.

372
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:15,490
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...

373
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:19,691
...for you are weary with sorrow and much toil.

374
00:51:22,091 --> 00:51:24,091
Tonight, you will sleep....

375
00:51:24,491 --> 00:51:27,791
<i>Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...</i>

376
00:51:29,391 --> 00:51:31,092
<i>...one who has seen the eye!</i>

377
00:51:45,793 --> 00:51:48,293
A lament for Gandalf.

378
00:51:55,694 --> 00:51:57,094
What do they say about him?

379
00:51:57,594 --> 00:51:59,994
I have not the heart to tell you.

380
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:05,195
For me, the grief is still too near.

381
00:52:08,195 --> 00:52:10,995
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.

382
00:52:11,395 --> 00:52:14,196
There should be a verse about them.

383
00:52:17,696 --> 00:52:19,596
The finest rockets ever seen

384
00:52:20,796 --> 00:52:23,596
They burst in stars of blue and green

385
00:52:24,696 --> 00:52:29,697
Or after thunder, silver showers

386
00:52:30,497 --> 00:52:33,197
Came falling like a rain of flowers

387
00:52:33,597 --> 00:52:37,298
Oh, that doesn't do them justice by a long road.

388
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:50,799
Take some rest.

389
00:52:51,099 --> 00:52:53,699
These borders are well-protected.

390
00:52:53,999 --> 00:52:56,399
I will find no rest here.

391
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,200
I heard her voice inside my head.

392
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:06,200
She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor.

393
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:11,701
She said to me; "Even now there is hope Left."

394
00:53:13,401 --> 00:53:16,001
But I cannot see it.

395
00:53:17,501 --> 00:53:19,902
It is long since we had any hope.

396
00:53:30,203 --> 00:53:32,303
My father is a noble man.

397
00:53:33,103 --> 00:53:35,303
But his rule is failing...

398
00:53:38,503 --> 00:53:40,904
...and our people lose faith.

399
00:53:42,504 --> 00:53:45,904
He looks to me to make things right,
and I would do it.

400
00:53:46,204 --> 00:53:49,604
I would see the glory of Gondor restored.

401
00:53:52,605 --> 00:53:55,505
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

402
00:53:56,205 --> 00:53:58,105
The white tower of Ecthelion.

403
00:53:58,505 --> 00:54:02,105
Glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver.

404
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:06,306
Its banners caught high in the morning breeze.

405
00:54:09,406 --> 00:54:11,306
Have you ever been called home...

406
00:54:11,306 --> 00:54:15,307
...by the clear ringing of silver trumpets?

407
00:54:16,107 --> 00:54:19,107
I have seen the white city...

408
00:54:19,607 --> 00:54:21,007
...long ago.

409
00:54:22,107 --> 00:54:26,908
One day, our paths will lead us there.

410
00:54:28,008 --> 00:54:30,808
And the tower guard shall take up the call:

411
00:54:31,508 --> 00:54:34,608
"The Lords of Gondor have returned."

412
00:55:42,015 --> 00:55:44,415
Will you look into the mirror?

413
00:55:44,715 --> 00:55:46,115
What will I see?

414
00:55:49,215 --> 00:55:51,516
Even the wisest cannot tell.

415
00:55:52,416 --> 00:55:54,216
For the mirror...

416
00:55:54,516 --> 00:55:56,916
...shows many things.

417
00:56:00,016 --> 00:56:02,216
Things that were...

418
00:56:02,617 --> 00:56:05,117
...things that are...

419
00:56:05,917 --> 00:56:07,717
...and some things...

420
00:56:11,517 --> 00:56:14,718
...that have not yet come to pass.

421
00:57:37,325 --> 00:57:40,126
I know what it is you saw.

422
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:44,926
For it is also in my mind.

423
00:57:46,926 --> 00:57:50,726
<i>It is what will come to pass if you should fail.</i>

424
00:57:53,327 --> 00:57:57,927
<i>The fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.</i>

425
00:57:58,827 --> 00:58:02,028
<i>He will try to take the ring.</i>

426
00:58:02,328 --> 00:58:04,228
<i>You know of whom I speak.</i>

427
00:58:05,328 --> 00:58:09,728
<i>One by one, it will destroy them all.</i>

428
00:58:11,528 --> 00:58:13,829
<i>If you ask it of me...</i>

429
00:58:14,329 --> 00:58:17,229
<i>... I will give you the one ring.</i>

430
00:58:18,529 --> 00:58:20,629
<i>You offer it to me freely.</i>

431
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:28,930
<i>I do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this.</i>

432
00:58:35,631 --> 00:58:38,731
In place of a dark lord, you would have a queen...

433
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:42,831
...not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn!

434
00:58:43,731 --> 00:58:46,632
Treacherous as the sea!

435
00:58:47,132 --> 00:58:51,932
Stronger than the foundations of the earth!

436
00:58:52,632 --> 00:58:54,932
All shall love me...

437
00:58:55,232 --> 00:58:57,933
...and despair.

438
00:59:12,134 --> 00:59:16,334
I pass the test. I will diminish...

439
00:59:16,734 --> 00:59:19,035
...and go into the West...

440
00:59:19,435 --> 00:59:23,735
...and remain Galadriel.
- I cannot do this alone.

441
00:59:27,435 --> 00:59:31,436
You are a ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a ring of power...

442
00:59:32,536 --> 00:59:33,936
...is to be alone.

443
00:59:37,436 --> 00:59:40,137
This is Nenya, the ring of Adamant.

444
00:59:40,437 --> 00:59:41,937
And I am its keeper.

445
00:59:45,237 --> 00:59:48,737
This task was appointed to you.

446
00:59:49,937 --> 00:59:52,638
And if you do not find a way...

447
00:59:54,038 --> 00:59:55,938
...no one will.

448
00:59:56,438 --> 00:59:59,438
Then I know what I must do.

449
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:01,338
It's just...

450
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:06,839
...I'm afraid to do it.

451
01:00:10,339 --> 01:00:15,340
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

452
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:26,441
Do you know how the orcs first came into being?

453
01:00:27,441 --> 01:00:30,541
They were elves once.

454
01:00:31,841 --> 01:00:35,042
Taken by the dark powers...

455
01:00:35,542 --> 01:00:38,542
...tortured and mutilated.

456
01:00:38,942 --> 01:00:44,042
A ruined and terrible form of life.

457
01:00:44,442 --> 01:00:46,243
And now...

458
01:00:47,843 --> 01:00:49,643
...perfected.

459
01:00:50,443 --> 01:00:53,443
My fighting Uruk-hai...

460
01:00:55,543 --> 01:00:57,744
...whom do you serve?

461
01:00:58,044 --> 01:01:00,444
Saruman!

462
01:01:21,346 --> 01:01:24,646
Hunt them down. Do not stop until, they are found.

463
01:01:25,046 --> 01:01:27,846
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

464
01:01:28,146 --> 01:01:30,947
You will taste man-flesh!

465
01:01:36,147 --> 01:01:39,648
One of the halflings carries
something of great value.

466
01:01:40,048 --> 01:01:44,048
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

467
01:01:46,148 --> 01:01:47,348
Kill the others.

468
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:11,750
Never before have we clad strangers
in the garb of our own people.

469
01:02:13,051 --> 01:02:16,751
May these cloaks help shield
you from unfriendly eyes.

470
01:02:24,052 --> 01:02:25,652
Lembas.

471
01:02:25,952 --> 01:02:27,552
Elvish waybread.

472
01:02:29,952 --> 01:02:32,852
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

473
01:02:39,453 --> 01:02:41,353
How many did you eat?

474
01:02:41,353 --> 01:02:43,153
Four.

475
01:02:49,054 --> 01:02:51,554
Every league you travel south,
the danger will increase.

476
01:02:51,854 --> 01:02:55,755
Mordor orcs now hold the
eastern shore of the Anduin.

477
01:02:56,155 --> 01:02:58,555
Nor will you find safety on the western bank.

478
01:02:58,855 --> 01:03:02,555
Strange creatures bearing the mark of the
white hand have been seen on our borders.

479
01:03:02,955 --> 01:03:07,756
Seldom do orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

480
01:03:16,186 --> 01:03:18,331
[Sindarin] <i>Le aphadar aen.</i>
[English] You are being tracked.

481
01:03:20,657 --> 01:03:25,057
By river you have the chance of outrunning
the enemy to the falls of Rauros.

482
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:47,159
<i>My gift for you, Legolas, is a bow of the Galadhrim.</i>

483
01:03:47,559 --> 01:03:50,860
<i>Worthy of the skill of our woodland kin.</i>

484
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:58,860
<i>These are the daggers of the Noldorin.</i>

485
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:02,961
<i>They have already seen service in war.</i>

486
01:04:03,261 --> 01:04:05,461
<i>Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.</i>

487
01:04:05,761 --> 01:04:08,861
<i>You will find your courage.</i>

488
01:04:10,861 --> 01:04:12,862
<i>And for you, Samwise Gamgee...</i>

489
01:04:12,862 --> 01:04:15,762
<i>...Elven rope made of hithlain.</i>

490
01:04:15,762 --> 01:04:17,962
Thank you, my lady.

491
01:04:19,862 --> 01:04:23,063
Have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers?

492
01:04:29,563 --> 01:04:32,463
And what gift would a dwarf ask of the elves?

493
01:04:32,863 --> 01:04:34,964
Nothing.

494
01:04:35,664 --> 01:04:38,864
Except to look upon the lady
of the Galadhrim one last time...

495
01:04:39,564 --> 01:04:44,565
...for she is more fair than all
the jewels beneath the earth.

496
01:04:51,765 --> 01:04:53,265
Actually....

497
01:04:53,565 --> 01:04:55,166
There was one thing.

498
01:04:56,066 --> 01:04:58,566
No, no, I couldn't.
It's quite impossible.

499
01:04:58,866 --> 01:05:01,566
Stupid to ask.

500
01:05:04,266 --> 01:05:06,267
<i>I have nothing greater to give...</i>

501
01:05:06,267 --> 01:05:09,967
<i>...than the gift you already bear.</i>

502
01:05:10,670 --> 01:05:11,713
[Sindarin] <i>Am meleth dîn...</i>
[English] For her love...

503
01:05:12,989 --> 01:05:18,245
[Sindarin] <i>...I ant e guil Arwen Undómiel pígatha.</i>
[English] ...the gift of life of Arwen will fade.

504
01:05:19,396 --> 01:05:21,233
[Sindarin] <i>Aníron i e broniatha...</i>
[English] I wish that she endures...

505
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:26,279
[Sindarin] <i>...Ad ae periatham athar i methid en-amar hen.</i>
[English] ...even if we separate beyond the limits of this world.

506
01:05:28,982 --> 01:05:34,995
[Sindarin] <i>Aníron i e círatha na Valinor.</i>
[English] I wish that she sails to Valinor.

507
01:05:35,469 --> 01:05:38,369
That choice is yet before her.

508
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:42,070
You have your own choice to make, Aragorn.

509
01:05:42,470 --> 01:05:47,970
To rise above the height of all your
fathers since the days of Elendil...

510
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:52,671
...or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

511
01:05:59,756 --> 01:06:00,792
[Quenya] <i>Namárië.</i>
[English] Farewell.

512
01:06:05,071 --> 01:06:07,949
[Sindarin] <i>Nadath nâ i moe cerich...</i>
[English] There is much you have yet to do...

513
01:06:10,456 --> 01:06:11,750
[Sindarin] <i>...dan...</i>
[English] ...but...

514
01:06:14,733 --> 01:06:17,893
[Sindarin] <i>...ú-'eveditham, Elessar.</i>
[English] ...we shall not meet again, Elessar.

515
01:06:20,473 --> 01:06:23,574
<i>Farewell, Frodo Baggins.</i>

516
01:06:23,574 --> 01:06:27,074
<i>I give you the light of Earendil...</i>

517
01:06:28,074 --> 01:06:30,274
<i>...our most beloved star.</i>

518
01:06:39,475 --> 01:06:43,675
<i>May it be a light for you in dark places...</i>

519
01:06:44,076 --> 01:06:48,076
<i>... when all other lights go out.</i>

520
01:06:57,177 --> 01:07:00,177
I have taken my worst wound at this parting...

521
01:07:00,977 --> 01:07:04,977
...having looked my last upon that which is fairest.

522
01:07:05,978 --> 01:07:09,178
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

523
01:07:09,578 --> 01:07:11,478
What was her gift?

524
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:16,478
I asked her for one hair from her golden head.

525
01:07:17,379 --> 01:07:20,179
She gave me three.

526
01:09:02,488 --> 01:09:05,789
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

527
01:09:09,689 --> 01:09:12,589
I had hoped we would lose him on the river.

528
01:09:12,989 --> 01:09:15,989
But he's too clever a waterman.

529
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:20,190
And if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts...

530
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:22,490
...it will make the crossing even more dangerous.

531
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:24,790
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

532
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:28,091
- No, Sam.
- You haven't eaten anything all day.

533
01:09:28,491 --> 01:09:31,391
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

534
01:09:32,391 --> 01:09:35,291
- Mr. Frodo
- I'm all right.

535
01:09:35,591 --> 01:09:36,691
But you're not.

536
01:09:37,091 --> 01:09:39,592
I'm here to help you.

537
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:41,392
I promised Gandalf that I would.

538
01:09:47,492 --> 01:09:49,993
You can't help me, Sam.

539
01:09:52,393 --> 01:09:53,993
Not this time.

540
01:09:56,993 --> 01:09:58,993
Get some sleep.

541
01:10:05,394 --> 01:10:07,494
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

542
01:10:08,094 --> 01:10:10,695
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

543
01:10:11,495 --> 01:10:13,595
Strike out for Mordor from a place of strength.

544
01:10:13,995 --> 01:10:16,695
There is no strength in Gondor that can avail us.

545
01:10:17,395 --> 01:10:19,295
You were quick enough to trust the elves.

546
01:10:21,195 --> 01:10:23,996
Have you so little faith in your own people?

547
01:10:23,996 --> 01:10:26,996
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

548
01:10:27,396 --> 01:10:30,596
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in men.

549
01:10:30,896 --> 01:10:32,997
But you will not see that.

550
01:10:33,497 --> 01:10:34,797
You are afraid!

551
01:10:35,197 --> 01:10:37,597
All your life, you have hidden in the shadows.

552
01:10:37,997 --> 01:10:41,297
Scared of who you are, of what you are.

553
01:10:43,898 --> 01:10:48,098
I will not lead the ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

554
01:11:00,099 --> 01:11:01,399
Frodo.

555
01:11:03,299 --> 01:11:04,699
The Argonath.

556
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:11,800
Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old.

557
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:14,500
My kin.

558
01:12:33,708 --> 01:12:35,708
We cross the lake at nightfall.

559
01:12:36,108 --> 01:12:38,508
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

560
01:12:38,808 --> 01:12:42,108
- We approach Mordor from the North.
- Oh, yes?

561
01:12:42,708 --> 01:12:46,409
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

562
01:12:46,709 --> 01:12:49,809
...an impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks.

563
01:12:50,109 --> 01:12:53,109
And after that, it gets even better.

564
01:12:53,609 --> 01:12:58,310
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

565
01:12:58,810 --> 01:13:00,110
That is our road.

566
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:04,811
I suggest you take some rest and
recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

567
01:13:05,111 --> 01:13:06,711
Recover my...

568
01:13:09,911 --> 01:13:11,711
- We should Leave now.
- No.

569
01:13:12,011 --> 01:13:16,212
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

570
01:13:16,612 --> 01:13:20,012
It is not the eastern shore that worries me.

571
01:13:20,312 --> 01:13:24,112
A shadow and a threat has
been growing in my mind.

572
01:13:24,812 --> 01:13:28,813
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

573
01:13:31,013 --> 01:13:35,713
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young hobbit.

574
01:13:36,513 --> 01:13:38,114
Where's Frodo?

575
01:14:03,816 --> 01:14:05,716
None of us should wander alone.

576
01:14:07,016 --> 01:14:09,116
You, least of all.

577
01:14:09,416 --> 01:14:11,717
So much depends on you.

578
01:14:12,917 --> 01:14:14,817
Frodo?

579
01:14:22,018 --> 01:14:24,518
I know why you seek solitude.

580
01:14:25,318 --> 01:14:28,618
You suffer. I see it day by day.

581
01:14:29,518 --> 01:14:32,519
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

582
01:14:34,219 --> 01:14:36,819
There are other ways, Frodo.

583
01:14:37,119 --> 01:14:40,819
- Other paths that we might take.
- I know what you would say.

584
01:14:41,119 --> 01:14:44,720
It would seem like wisdom but
for the warning in my heart.

585
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:48,120
Warning...against what?

586
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:50,420
We're all afraid, Frodo.

587
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:54,221
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

588
01:14:54,621 --> 01:14:58,221
...don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.

589
01:15:00,221 --> 01:15:03,321
I ask only for the strength to defend my people!

590
01:15:05,122 --> 01:15:07,022
- If you would but lend me the ring.
- No.

591
01:15:08,322 --> 01:15:11,822
- Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
- You are not yourself.

592
01:15:13,922 --> 01:15:17,023
What chance do you think you have?

593
01:15:17,323 --> 01:15:21,823
They will find you.
They will take the ring.

594
01:15:22,223 --> 01:15:25,823
And you will beg for death before the end!

595
01:15:28,124 --> 01:15:30,124
You fool!

596
01:15:30,124 --> 01:15:34,224
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

597
01:15:34,524 --> 01:15:37,225
It should be mine! Give it to me!

598
01:15:37,525 --> 01:15:38,725
- Give it to me!
- No!

599
01:15:39,025 --> 01:15:40,825
- Give it to me!
- No.

600
01:15:48,526 --> 01:15:50,426
I see your mind.

601
01:15:50,826 --> 01:15:53,626
You will take the ring to Sauron!

602
01:15:53,926 --> 01:15:55,726
You will betray us!

603
01:15:56,026 --> 01:15:59,127
You'll go to your death, and the death of us all!

604
01:15:59,627 --> 01:16:03,127
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

605
01:16:10,328 --> 01:16:11,828
Frodo?

606
01:16:16,128 --> 01:16:17,728
Frodo.

607
01:16:21,729 --> 01:16:23,629
What have I done?

608
01:16:23,929 --> 01:16:25,629
Please, Frodo.

609
01:16:25,929 --> 01:16:28,429
Frodo, I'm sorry!

610
01:16:54,917 --> 01:16:56,917
[Black Speech] Akha...
[English] Here...

611
01:16:58,242 --> 01:17:00,042
[Black Speech] ...ashi...
[English] ...only...

612
01:16:58,832 --> 01:17:02,332
Ash Ghurûm
(They will fall)

613
01:17:00,103 --> 01:17:01,603
[Black Speech] ...gurum!
[English] ...death!

614
01:17:17,134 --> 01:17:18,434
Frodo?

615
01:17:19,734 --> 01:17:22,734
- It has taken Boromir.
- Where is the ring?

616
01:17:23,134 --> 01:17:24,834
Stay away!

617
01:17:25,234 --> 01:17:26,835
Frodo!

618
01:17:29,135 --> 01:17:32,835
- I swore to protect you.
- Can you protect me from yourself?

619
01:17:42,736 --> 01:17:45,036
Would you destroy it?

620
01:17:50,237 --> 01:17:52,037
<i>Aragorn.</i>

621
01:17:55,537 --> 01:17:57,737
<i>Aragorn.</i>

622
01:17:59,738 --> 01:18:01,438
<i>Elessar.</i>

623
01:18:09,139 --> 01:18:12,339
I would have gone with you to the end.

624
01:18:13,139 --> 01:18:15,939
Into the very fires of Mordor.

625
01:18:19,439 --> 01:18:20,540
I know.

626
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:28,240
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.

627
01:18:32,241 --> 01:18:33,841
Go, Frodo!

628
01:18:36,941 --> 01:18:38,441
Run.

629
01:18:38,441 --> 01:18:40,241
Run!

630
01:19:04,844 --> 01:19:06,444
Mr. Frodo!

631
01:19:15,945 --> 01:19:17,545
Find the halfling!

632
01:19:19,245 --> 01:19:21,645
Find the halfling!

633
01:19:25,346 --> 01:19:26,946
Elendil!

634
01:19:33,446 --> 01:19:34,946
Aragorn, go!

635
01:19:56,648 --> 01:19:57,949
Frodo!

636
01:19:58,549 --> 01:20:00,149
Hide here. Quick!

637
01:20:00,849 --> 01:20:02,249
Come on!

638
01:20:04,749 --> 01:20:06,749
What's he doing?

639
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:12,950
He's leaving.

640
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:20,651
- No!
- Pippin!

641
01:20:25,651 --> 01:20:27,851
Run, Frodo. Go!

642
01:20:28,551 --> 01:20:31,452
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Over here!

643
01:20:32,052 --> 01:20:33,552
- Over here!
- This way!

644
01:20:44,553 --> 01:20:46,753
- It's working!
- I know it's working! Run!

645
01:21:42,158 --> 01:21:45,058
- The horn of Gondor.
- Boromir.

646
01:22:28,362 --> 01:22:29,362
Run!

647
01:26:01,082 --> 01:26:02,582
No.

648
01:26:06,682 --> 01:26:09,583
- They took the little ones.
- Hold still.

649
01:26:09,883 --> 01:26:11,883
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

650
01:26:13,883 --> 01:26:15,283
I let Frodo go.

651
01:26:15,983 --> 01:26:18,483
Then you did what I could not.

652
01:26:19,584 --> 01:26:22,784
I tried to take the ring from him.

653
01:26:23,384 --> 01:26:27,484
- The ring is beyond our reach now.
- Forgive me.

654
01:26:27,884 --> 01:26:30,085
I did not see it.

655
01:26:30,385 --> 01:26:33,485
- I have failed you all.
- No, Boromir.

656
01:26:34,085 --> 01:26:36,485
You fought bravely.

657
01:26:36,885 --> 01:26:39,385
You have kept your honor.

658
01:26:40,185 --> 01:26:41,886
Leave it.

659
01:26:42,386 --> 01:26:44,386
It is over.

660
01:26:45,686 --> 01:26:50,786
The world of men will fall and
all will come to darkness...

661
01:26:51,387 --> 01:26:54,187
...and my city to ruin.

662
01:26:58,387 --> 01:27:01,087
I do not know what strength is in my blood...

663
01:27:01,087 --> 01:27:05,188
...but I swear to you, I will
not let the white city fall...

664
01:27:06,288 --> 01:27:08,688
...nor our people fail.

665
01:27:09,688 --> 01:27:11,088
Our people.

666
01:27:14,989 --> 01:27:16,989
Our people.

667
01:27:38,791 --> 01:27:41,691
I would have followed you, my brother.

668
01:27:43,391 --> 01:27:45,291
My captain.

669
01:27:48,092 --> 01:27:49,892
My king.

670
01:28:09,594 --> 01:28:11,694
Be at peace...

671
01:28:12,294 --> 01:28:14,094
...son of Gondor.

672
01:28:30,596 --> 01:28:33,796
They will look for his coming from the white tower.

673
01:28:34,496 --> 01:28:37,396
But he will not return.

674
01:29:00,798 --> 01:29:02,699
Frodo!

675
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:25,401
<i>I wish the ring had never come to me.</i>

676
01:29:26,701 --> 01:29:29,501
<i>I wish none of this had happened.</i>

677
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:35,402
<i>So do all who live to see such times...</i>

678
01:29:35,702 --> 01:29:39,002
<i>...but that is not for them to decide.</i>

679
01:29:39,402 --> 01:29:41,902
<i>All you have to decide...</i>

680
01:29:42,202 --> 01:29:46,803
<i>...is what to do with the time that is given to you.</i>

681
01:30:15,705 --> 01:30:17,705
Frodo, no!

682
01:30:18,506 --> 01:30:19,706
Frodo!

683
01:30:20,406 --> 01:30:23,006
- Mr. Frodo!
- No, Sam.

684
01:30:26,706 --> 01:30:28,606
Go back, Sam!

685
01:30:29,207 --> 01:30:32,607
- I'm going to Mordor alone.
- Of course you are.

686
01:30:32,907 --> 01:30:35,607
And I'm coming with you!

687
01:30:36,307 --> 01:30:38,607
You can't swim!

688
01:30:42,408 --> 01:30:44,108
Sam!

689
01:30:49,708 --> 01:30:51,109
Sam!

690
01:31:32,012 --> 01:31:34,713
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

691
01:31:35,113 --> 01:31:39,213
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

692
01:31:40,513 --> 01:31:43,013
And I don't mean to.

693
01:31:43,413 --> 01:31:45,514
I don't mean to.

694
01:31:47,314 --> 01:31:49,014
Oh Sam.

695
01:32:04,015 --> 01:32:05,615
Come on.

696
01:32:34,018 --> 01:32:38,418
Hurry! Frodo and Sam have
reached the eastern shore.

697
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:58,420
- You mean not to follow them.
- Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

698
01:33:01,921 --> 01:33:06,621
Then it has all been in vain.
The fellowship has failed.

699
01:33:18,622 --> 01:33:21,722
Not if we hold true to each other.

700
01:33:23,223 --> 01:33:27,523
We will not abandon Merry and
Pippin to torment and death.

701
01:33:28,623 --> 01:33:33,724
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

702
01:33:35,224 --> 01:33:37,124
We travel light.

703
01:33:37,424 --> 01:33:39,324
Let us hunt some orc.

704
01:33:42,324 --> 01:33:44,324
Yes!

705
01:34:03,326 --> 01:34:04,726
Mordor.

706
01:34:05,426 --> 01:34:08,627
I hope the others find a safer road.

707
01:34:09,727 --> 01:34:12,227
Strider will look after them.

708
01:34:13,327 --> 01:34:16,527
I don't suppose we'll ever see them again.

709
01:34:17,027 --> 01:34:19,328
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

710
01:34:19,328 --> 01:34:21,028
We may.

711
01:34:23,228 --> 01:34:24,328
Sam...

712
01:34:27,929 --> 01:34:30,429
...I'm glad you are with me.
