5
00:00:28,908 --> 00:00:31,908
[Sindarin] <i>I amar prestar aen.</i>

6
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:33,999
The world is changed.

7
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:35,259
[Sindarin] <i>Han mathon ne nen.</i>

8
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:37,282
I feel it in the water.

9
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,159
[Sindarin] <i>Han mathon ne chae.</i>

10
00:00:39,599 --> 00:00:41,119
I feel it in the earth.

11
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:43,659
[Sindarin] <i>A han noston ned 'wilith.</i>

12
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:46,999
I smell it in the air.

13
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:49,299
Much that once was...

14
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:51,099
...is lost.

15
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,799
For none now live who remember it.

16
00:00:54,799 --> 00:01:02,300
The Lord of the Rings.

17
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,000
It began with the forging of the great rings.

18
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,200
Three were given to the elves:

19
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,100
Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,900
Seven to the dwarf-lords:

21
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,401
Great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.

22
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:28,201
And nine...

23
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:31,301
...nine rings were gifted to the race of men...

24
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:35,401
...who, above all else, desire power.

25
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:41,601
For within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race.

26
00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:46,401
But they were all of them deceived.

27
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:48,801
For another ring was made.

28
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:53,102
In the land of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom...

29
00:01:53,702 --> 00:01:58,002
... the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a master ring...

30
00:01:58,402 --> 00:02:00,302
... to control all others.

31
00:02:00,602 --> 00:02:04,402
And into this ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...

32
00:02:04,802 --> 00:02:08,802
...and his will to dominate all life.

33
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:13,702
One ring to rule them all.

34
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:16,303
One by one...

35
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:21,003
... the free lands of Middle-earth
fell to the power of the ring.

36
00:02:21,403 --> 00:02:24,303
But there were some who resisted.

37
00:02:25,003 --> 00:02:29,403
A last alliance of men and elves
marched against the armies of Mordor.

38
00:02:29,803 --> 00:02:34,303
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.

39
00:02:46,864 --> 00:02:48,064
[Sindarin] <i>Tangado haid!</i>
[English] Hold positions!

40
00:02:49,464 --> 00:02:51,464
[Sindarin] <i>Leithio i philinn!</i>
[English] Release the arrows!

41
00:03:04,804 --> 00:03:07,305
Victory was near.

42
00:03:12,105 --> 00:03:14,405
But the power of the ring...

43
00:03:14,705 --> 00:03:16,505
...could not be undone.

44
00:03:40,806 --> 00:03:42,606
It was in this moment...

45
00:03:42,906 --> 00:03:45,206
... when all hope had faded...

46
00:03:45,506 --> 00:03:49,406
... that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.

47
00:04:20,707 --> 00:04:26,908
Sauron, the enemy of the free peoples
of Middle-earth, was defeated.

48
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:36,208
The ring passed to Isildur...

49
00:04:36,508 --> 00:04:40,508
... who had this one chance to destroy evil forever.

50
00:04:41,408 --> 00:04:43,408
But the hearts of men...

51
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:46,108
...are easily corrupted.

52
00:04:46,508 --> 00:04:50,909
And the ring of power has a will of its own.

53
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,810
It betrayed Isildur...

54
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,110
... to his death.

55
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,110
And some things
that should not have been forgotten...

56
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,610
...were lost.

57
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,710
History became legend...

58
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,910
...legend became myth.

59
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,911
And for two and a half thousand years...

60
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:45,911
... the ring passed out of all knowledge.

61
00:05:46,611 --> 00:05:49,311
Until, when chance came...

62
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:53,111
...it ensnared a new bearer.

63
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:59,211
My precious.

64
00:05:59,711 --> 00:06:02,111
The ring came to the creature Gollum...

65
00:06:02,411 --> 00:06:06,111
... who took it deep into the tunnels
of the Misty Mountains.

66
00:06:06,611 --> 00:06:09,412
And there it consumed him.

67
00:06:09,712 --> 00:06:11,612
It came to me.

68
00:06:11,912 --> 00:06:16,212
My own. My love. My own.

69
00:06:16,612 --> 00:06:21,112
My precious.

70
00:06:24,912 --> 00:06:28,212
The ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life.

71
00:06:28,612 --> 00:06:32,212
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.

72
00:06:32,512 --> 00:06:36,913
And in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited.

73
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:40,513
Darkness crept back into the forests of the world.

74
00:06:40,913 --> 00:06:43,613
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...

75
00:06:43,913 --> 00:06:46,613
... whispers of a nameless fear.

76
00:06:46,913 --> 00:06:50,113
And the ring of power perceived...

77
00:06:50,513 --> 00:06:53,113
...its time had now come.

78
00:06:55,713 --> 00:06:58,213
It abandoned Gollum.

79
00:06:59,014 --> 00:07:03,214
But something happened then
the ring did not intend.

80
00:07:04,314 --> 00:07:08,714
It was picked up by the most
unlikely creature imaginable.

81
00:07:09,114 --> 00:07:10,114
What's this?

82
00:07:10,414 --> 00:07:11,814
A hobbit.

83
00:07:11,814 --> 00:07:14,614
Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

84
00:07:15,014 --> 00:07:16,714
A ring.

85
00:07:16,714 --> 00:07:18,714
Lost!

86
00:07:23,114 --> 00:07:24,815
My precious is lost!

87
00:07:25,215 --> 00:07:27,415
For the time will soon come...

88
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:32,715
... when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.

89
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,490
The 22nd day of September...

90
00:07:40,515 --> 00:07:43,615
...in the year 1400...

91
00:07:44,015 --> 00:07:46,215
...by Shire-reckoning.

92
00:07:46,615 --> 00:07:52,416
Bag End, Bagshot Row.
Hobbiton, Westfarthing...

93
00:07:52,816 --> 00:07:54,716
...the Shire...

94
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,716
...Middle-earth.

95
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:05,616
The third age of this world.

96
00:08:08,016 --> 00:08:13,016
The Fellowship of the Ring.

97
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:19,917
There and back again.

98
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:23,617
A Hobbit's tale.

99
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:27,717
By Bilbo Baggins.

100
00:08:32,617 --> 00:08:34,217
Now...

101
00:08:35,117 --> 00:08:37,017
...where to begin?

102
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,417
Ah, yes....

103
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:45,718
"Concerning...

104
00:08:46,918 --> 00:08:48,418
...Hobbits."

105
00:08:49,618 --> 00:08:53,018
Hobbits have been living and farming
in the four Farthings of the Shire...

106
00:08:53,318 --> 00:08:55,318
...for many hundreds of years...

107
00:08:55,318 --> 00:08:58,618
...quite content to ignore and be ignored...

108
00:08:58,618 --> 00:09:01,718
...by the world of the big folk.

109
00:09:02,218 --> 00:09:07,619
Middle-earth being, after all,
full of strange creatures beyond count...

110
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:11,119
...Hobbits must seem of little importance...

111
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:15,219
...being neither renowned as great warriors...

112
00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:19,619
...nor counted among the very wise.

113
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:27,019
Frodo! Someone at the door.

114
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,819
In fact, it has been remarked by some...

115
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:35,320
... that Hobbits' only real passion is for food.

116
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,020
A rather unfair observation...

117
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,720
...as we have also developed a keen
interest in the brewing of ales...

118
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,020
...and the smoking of pipe-weed.

119
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,320
But where our hearts truly lie...

120
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,620
...is in peace and quiet...

121
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,520
...and good, tilled earth.

122
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,821
For all Hobbits share a love of things that grow.

123
00:10:02,121 --> 00:10:06,321
And yes, no doubt to others our ways seem quaint.

124
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:11,721
But today of all days.
It is brought home to me...

125
00:10:12,521 --> 00:10:18,221
It is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.

126
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:25,722
Frodo, the door!

127
00:10:29,622 --> 00:10:31,522
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

128
00:10:31,522 --> 00:10:33,422
Frodo!

129
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:42,622
<i>Down from the door where it began</i>

130
00:10:47,622 --> 00:10:51,223
<i>And I must follow if I can</i>

131
00:10:52,423 --> 00:10:56,423
<i>The road goes ever on and on</i>

132
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:59,923
<i>Down from the door where it began</i>

133
00:11:00,423 --> 00:11:05,123
<i>Now far ahead the road has gone</i>

134
00:11:06,023 --> 00:11:09,623
<i>And I must follow if I can
- You're late.</i>

135
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:16,724
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

136
00:11:17,624 --> 00:11:22,124
Nor is he early.
He arrives precisely when he means to.

137
00:11:33,624 --> 00:11:36,524
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

138
00:11:40,524 --> 00:11:44,125
You didn't think I'd miss
your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

139
00:11:45,925 --> 00:11:48,025
How is the old rascal?

140
00:11:48,725 --> 00:11:52,125
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

141
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:54,725
You know Bilbo.
He's got the whole piece in an uproar.

142
00:11:55,025 --> 00:11:56,925
Well, that should please him.

143
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,925
Half the Shire's been invited.

144
00:11:59,325 --> 00:12:01,825
And the rest of them are turning up anyway.

145
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:08,226
And so life in the Shire goes on...

146
00:12:08,626 --> 00:12:11,526
... very much as it has this past age.

147
00:12:11,826 --> 00:12:17,126
Full of its own comings and goings,
with change coming slowly.

148
00:12:17,426 --> 00:12:19,326
If it comes at all.

149
00:12:20,726 --> 00:12:24,026
For things are made to endure in the Shire...

150
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:27,626
...passing from one generation to the next.

151
00:12:28,226 --> 00:12:33,027
There's always been a Baggins
living here under the Hill...

152
00:12:33,427 --> 00:12:34,727
...in Bag End.

153
00:12:37,527 --> 00:12:40,227
And there always will be.

154
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:44,227
To tell you the truth,
Bilbo's been a bit odd lateIy.

155
00:12:45,627 --> 00:12:47,827
I mean, more than usual.

156
00:12:48,927 --> 00:12:50,727
He's taken to locking himself in his study.

157
00:12:52,427 --> 00:12:56,427
He spends hours and hours poring over
old maps when he thinks I'm not looking.

158
00:13:09,328 --> 00:13:10,928
Where's it gone?

159
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:39,729
He's up to something.

160
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:50,330
- All right, then. Keep your secrets.
- What?

161
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,230
But I know you have something to do with it.

162
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,630
Good gracious me.

163
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,730
Before you came along, we Bagginses
were very well thought of.

164
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:57,930
Indeed.

165
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,430
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

166
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:06,730
If you're referring to the incident with the dragon.
I was barely involved.

167
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:10,630
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

168
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:14,930
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

169
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,331
Oh, really?

170
00:14:23,031 --> 00:14:24,931
Gandalf! Gandalf!

171
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:32,331
Fireworks, Gandalf!

172
00:14:35,431 --> 00:14:37,931
- Gandalf!
- Fireworks, Gandalf!

173
00:14:56,932 --> 00:14:57,932
Gandalf?

174
00:14:58,532 --> 00:15:02,432
- I'm glad you're back.
- So am I, dear boy.

175
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:08,833
So am I.

176
00:15:40,734 --> 00:15:42,134
No, thank you!

177
00:15:42,134 --> 00:15:46,034
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!

178
00:15:46,534 --> 00:15:49,834
And what about very old friends?

179
00:15:53,234 --> 00:15:54,834
Gandalf?

180
00:15:55,534 --> 00:15:58,835
- Bilbo Baggins.
- My dear Gandalf!

181
00:15:59,235 --> 00:16:04,135
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?

182
00:16:06,135 --> 00:16:08,035
You haven't aged a day.

183
00:16:14,735 --> 00:16:16,635
Come on, come in!

184
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:19,235
Welcome, welcome.

185
00:16:20,535 --> 00:16:22,935
Oh, here we are.

186
00:16:24,736 --> 00:16:27,136
Tea...or maybe something a littIe stronger?

187
00:16:27,136 --> 00:16:31,036
I've got a few bottles of the old winyard left - 1296.

188
00:16:31,336 --> 00:16:35,136
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

189
00:16:36,536 --> 00:16:40,836
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

190
00:16:41,236 --> 00:16:43,736
Just tea, thank you.

191
00:16:50,337 --> 00:16:51,837
I was expecting you sometime last week.

192
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:55,337
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

193
00:16:55,637 --> 00:17:00,637
You caught me a bit unprepared I'm afraid.
We've only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle....

194
00:17:01,037 --> 00:17:04,237
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.

195
00:17:04,637 --> 00:17:08,437
We've got raspberry jam, an apple tart....

196
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:13,137
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.

197
00:17:13,437 --> 00:17:16,138
I've just found some sponge cake.

198
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,438
I could make you some eggs if you'd li...

199
00:17:24,338 --> 00:17:26,938
- Just tea, thank you.
- Oh, right.

200
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:30,238
- You don't mind if I eat, do you?
- No, not at all.

201
00:17:31,538 --> 00:17:33,338
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

202
00:17:33,638 --> 00:17:35,138
I'm not at home!

203
00:17:41,238 --> 00:17:43,739
It's the Sackville-Bagginses.

204
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,039
- I know you're in there!
- They're after the house.

205
00:17:46,739 --> 00:17:49,139
They've never forgiven me for living this long.

206
00:17:49,439 --> 00:17:52,139
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day...

207
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:54,239
...never giving me a moment's peace.

208
00:17:55,139 --> 00:17:58,539
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!

209
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:03,239
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

210
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:07,340
- So you mean to go through with your plan?
- Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

211
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,840
All the arrangements are made.

212
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,440
Oh, thank you.

213
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,240
Frodo suspects something.

214
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,940
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

215
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,740
...not some blockheaded Bracegirdle
from Hardbottle.

216
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,140
You will tell him, won't you?

217
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,040
- Yes, yes.
- He's very fond of you.

218
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,840
I know.

219
00:18:34,241 --> 00:18:37,541
He'd probably come with me if I asked him.

220
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:41,441
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the Shire.

221
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:45,441
The woods, the fields.

222
00:18:45,741 --> 00:18:47,941
Little rivers.

223
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:55,141
I am old, Gandalf.

224
00:18:56,641 --> 00:19:01,642
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

225
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,542
I feel thin.

226
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:08,442
Sort of stretched...

227
00:19:09,742 --> 00:19:12,942
...like butter scraped over too much bread.

228
00:19:13,342 --> 00:19:17,642
I need a holiday. A very Long holiday.

229
00:19:17,942 --> 00:19:21,042
And I don't expect I shall return.

230
00:19:23,442 --> 00:19:26,543
In fact, I mean not to.

231
00:19:29,243 --> 00:19:33,143
Old Toby.
The finest weed in the Southfarthing.

232
00:19:50,744 --> 00:19:53,244
Gandalf, my old friend...

233
00:19:53,244 --> 00:19:56,144
...this will be a night to remember.

234
00:20:19,045 --> 00:20:20,145
Hello, hello.

235
00:20:20,445 --> 00:20:24,345
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

236
00:20:25,545 --> 00:20:27,945
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

237
00:20:30,645 --> 00:20:34,045
- I think I'll just have another ale.
- Oh, no, you don't.

238
00:20:35,245 --> 00:20:37,045
Go on!

239
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,946
So there I was...

240
00:20:49,246 --> 00:20:53,246
...at the mercy of three monstrous trolls.

241
00:20:53,546 --> 00:20:55,446
And they were all arguing amongst themselves...

242
00:20:55,446 --> 00:20:57,946
...about how they were going to cook us.

243
00:20:58,246 --> 00:21:03,146
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jelly.

244
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,747
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

245
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:11,547
...that the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees...

246
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:15,047
...and turned them all to stone!

247
00:21:20,547 --> 00:21:21,847
Quickly.

248
00:21:26,047 --> 00:21:28,047
Up they go!

249
00:21:30,947 --> 00:21:32,247
No no, the big one - big one

250
00:21:41,348 --> 00:21:44,148
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

251
00:21:44,148 --> 00:21:46,248
Are all these children yours?

252
00:21:46,248 --> 00:21:49,348
Good gracious, you have been productive.

253
00:21:51,448 --> 00:21:52,748
Bilbo?

254
00:21:54,448 --> 00:21:56,148
Sackville-Bagginses!

255
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:57,448
Quickly, hide!

256
00:22:07,449 --> 00:22:09,549
Thank you, my boy.

257
00:22:11,149 --> 00:22:13,349
You're a good lad, Frodo.

258
00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:17,449
I'm very selfish, you know.

259
00:22:17,949 --> 00:22:21,349
Yes, I am. Very selfish.

260
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:23,949
I don't know why I took you in after
your mother and father died...

261
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,650
...but it wasn't out of charity.

262
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,650
I think it was because...

263
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,050
...of all my numerous relations...

264
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,850
...you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit.

265
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,050
Bilbo, have you been at the Gaffer's home brew?

266
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,950
No.

267
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,750
Well, yes, but that's not the point.

268
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:44,250
The point is, Frodo...

269
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,350
...you'll be all right.

270
00:22:52,851 --> 00:22:54,751
- Done!
- You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

271
00:22:55,051 --> 00:22:56,551
- It is in the ground.
- Outside!

272
00:22:56,551 --> 00:22:58,251
This was your idea.

273
00:23:14,151 --> 00:23:15,652
Bilbo.

274
00:23:16,852 --> 00:23:19,452
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

275
00:23:19,752 --> 00:23:23,052
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for thousands of years.

276
00:23:36,652 --> 00:23:40,052
- That was good.
- Let's get another one.

277
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:45,853
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

278
00:23:46,253 --> 00:23:48,053
I might've known.

279
00:23:54,053 --> 00:23:56,053
Speech, Bilbo!

280
00:23:57,053 --> 00:23:58,353
Speech!

281
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,553
Speech!

282
00:24:04,853 --> 00:24:07,054
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

283
00:24:07,854 --> 00:24:09,954
...Tooks and Brandybucks...

284
00:24:10,254 --> 00:24:12,654
...Grubbs, Chubbs...

285
00:24:12,954 --> 00:24:13,954
...Hornblowers...

286
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:16,754
...Bolgers...

287
00:24:17,254 --> 00:24:18,754
...Bracegirdles...

288
00:24:19,054 --> 00:24:21,554
...and Proudfoots.
- Proudfeet!

289
00:24:23,854 --> 00:24:26,854
Today is my 111th birthday!

290
00:24:28,754 --> 00:24:30,254
Happy birthday!

291
00:24:30,254 --> 00:24:34,555
But alas, eleventy-one years is
far too short a time to live among...

292
00:24:34,955 --> 00:24:37,755
...such excellent and admirable Hobbits.

293
00:24:38,855 --> 00:24:41,455
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...

294
00:24:41,755 --> 00:24:46,155
...and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

295
00:24:56,355 --> 00:24:58,556
I have things to do.

296
00:25:05,056 --> 00:25:07,056
I've put this off for far too long.

297
00:25:11,056 --> 00:25:14,856
I regret to announce this is the end!

298
00:25:16,156 --> 00:25:17,256
I'm going now.

299
00:25:18,456 --> 00:25:21,256
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

300
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:24,857
Goodbye.

301
00:25:58,158 --> 00:26:01,158
I suppose you think that was terribly clever.

302
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:04,758
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

303
00:26:05,058 --> 00:26:07,858
There are many magic rings in
this world, Bilbo Baggins...

304
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:10,158
...and none of them should be used lightly.

305
00:26:10,158 --> 00:26:12,358
It was just a bit of fun.

306
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:16,259
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

307
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:21,159
- You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
- Two eyes.

308
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:24,059
As often as I can spare them.

309
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:27,459
- I'm leaving everything to him.
- What about this ring of yours?

310
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:30,959
- Is that staying too?
- Yes, yes.

311
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:35,459
It's in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece.

312
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:39,559
No. Wait, it's...

313
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,760
...here in my pocket.

314
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,560
Isn't that--? Isn't that odd, now?

315
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,760
Yet, after all, why not?

316
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,060
- Why shouldn t I keep it?
- I think you should leave the ring behind.

317
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,760
Is that so hard?

318
00:27:07,061 --> 00:27:08,361
Well, no.

319
00:27:10,861 --> 00:27:12,261
And yes.

320
00:27:14,261 --> 00:27:17,261
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel l ike parting with it.

321
00:27:17,661 --> 00:27:19,361
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

322
00:27:19,661 --> 00:27:23,661
- There's no need to get angry.
- Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

323
00:27:24,161 --> 00:27:25,861
It's mine.

324
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:29,761
My own.

325
00:27:30,161 --> 00:27:33,962
- My precious.
- Precious?

326
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:37,062
It's been called that before, but not by you.

327
00:27:37,462 --> 00:27:39,862
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

328
00:27:40,162 --> 00:27:42,862
I think you've had that ring quite long enough.

329
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,862
- You want it for yourself!
- Bilbo Baggins!

330
00:27:46,162 --> 00:27:50,262
Do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks.

331
00:27:50,662 --> 00:27:54,162
I am not trying to rob you.

332
00:27:59,363 --> 00:28:00,963
I'm trying to help you.

333
00:28:09,463 --> 00:28:12,663
All your long years, we've been friends.

334
00:28:13,163 --> 00:28:15,263
Trust me as you once did.

335
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:18,963
Let it go.

336
00:28:20,163 --> 00:28:22,463
You're right, Gandalf.

337
00:28:24,664 --> 00:28:27,264
The ring must go to Frodo.

338
00:28:28,764 --> 00:28:31,664
It's late. The road is long.

339
00:28:31,964 --> 00:28:34,364
Yes, it is time.

340
00:28:37,164 --> 00:28:41,964
Bilbo, the ring is still in your pocket.

341
00:29:16,966 --> 00:29:19,866
I've thought up an ending for my book:

342
00:29:21,566 --> 00:29:26,366
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

343
00:29:26,866 --> 00:29:30,166
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

344
00:29:31,266 --> 00:29:32,666
Goodbye, Gandalf.

345
00:29:35,266 --> 00:29:37,966
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

346
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:49,967
<i>The road goes ever on and on...</i>

347
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:55,067
Until our next meeting.

348
00:30:22,468 --> 00:30:25,968
It's mine. My own.

349
00:30:26,268 --> 00:30:29,668
My precious.

350
00:30:29,968 --> 00:30:32,768
Riddles in the dark.

351
00:30:33,169 --> 00:30:34,569
Bilbo!

352
00:30:34,569 --> 00:30:36,169
Bilbo!

353
00:30:39,969 --> 00:30:42,869
My precious.

354
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:46,569
Precious.

355
00:30:46,869 --> 00:30:49,269
He's gone, hasn't he?

356
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:55,169
He talked for so long about leaving...

357
00:30:55,469 --> 00:30:58,069
...I didn't think he'd really do it.

358
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:04,570
Gandalf?

359
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,470
Bilbo's ring.

360
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:17,170
He's gone to stay with the elves.

361
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:20,370
He's left you Bag End.

362
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:26,671
Along with all his possessions.

363
00:31:26,671 --> 00:31:29,671
The ring is yours now.

364
00:31:32,371 --> 00:31:35,771
- Put it somewhere out of sight.
- Where are you going?

365
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:38,171
- There are some things that I must see to.
- What things?

366
00:31:38,471 --> 00:31:42,571
- Questions. Questions that need answering.
- You've only just arrived.

367
00:31:43,671 --> 00:31:46,171
I don't understand.

368
00:31:49,571 --> 00:31:50,572
Neither do I.

369
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:56,172
Keep it secret.

370
00:31:56,172 --> 00:31:58,172
Keep it safe.

371
00:32:33,173 --> 00:32:35,273
Shire!

372
00:32:35,673 --> 00:32:37,691
Baggins!

373
00:33:27,275 --> 00:33:30,075
"The year 3434 of the second age.

374
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:34,576
Here follows the account of Isildur,
High King of Gondor...

375
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:38,576
...and the finding of the ring of power."

376
00:33:42,176 --> 00:33:43,976
"It has come to me.

377
00:33:44,276 --> 00:33:47,576
The one ring.
It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom.

378
00:33:47,876 --> 00:33:51,176
All those who follow in my bloodline
shall be bound to its fate...

379
00:33:51,576 --> 00:33:55,176
...for I will risk no hurt to the ring.

380
00:33:55,576 --> 00:33:57,976
It is precious to me...

381
00:33:58,977 --> 00:34:01,477
...though I buy it with great pain.

382
00:34:04,677 --> 00:34:08,677
The markings upon the band begin to fade.

383
00:34:09,177 --> 00:34:13,677
The writing, which at first was as clear
as red flame, has all but disappeared.

384
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:17,977
A secret now that only fire can tell."

385
00:34:34,778 --> 00:34:37,678
Shire...

386
00:34:37,678 --> 00:34:39,778
...Baggins.

387
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:44,278
There's no Bagginses around here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.

388
00:34:46,078 --> 00:34:47,478
That way.

389
00:34:51,279 --> 00:34:53,379
<i>"Hey ho to the dock I go</i>

390
00:34:53,379 --> 00:34:55,779
<i>To heal my heart and drown my woe</i>

391
00:34:55,779 --> 00:34:58,279
<i>Rain may fall and wind may blow</i>

392
00:34:58,279 --> 00:35:00,379
<i>But there still be...</i>

393
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:01,979
<i>...many miles to go</i>

394
00:35:02,279 --> 00:35:04,179
<i>Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain</i>

395
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:06,479
<i>And the stream that falls from hill to plain</i>

396
00:35:06,879 --> 00:35:08,579
<i>Better than rain or rippling brook</i>

397
00:35:08,879 --> 00:35:11,179
<i>Is a mug of beer inside this Took!"</i>

398
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:17,380
There's been some strange folk crossing the Shire.

399
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,580
Dwarves and others of a less than savory nature.

400
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,680
War is brewing.

401
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,080
The mountains are fair teeming with goblins.

402
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:30,080
Far-off tales and children s stories, that's all that is.

403
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:34,680
You're beginning to sound like that old
Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.

404
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,680
Young Mr. Frodo here, he's cracking.

405
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,480
And proud of it.

406
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,081
- Cheers, Gaffer.
- Aye. Cheers.

407
00:35:42,081 --> 00:35:46,081
Weel it's none of our concern what
goes on beyond our borders.

408
00:35:46,481 --> 00:35:50,481
Keep your nose out of trouble,
and no trouble'll come to you.

409
00:35:54,081 --> 00:35:56,181
- Good night, lads.
- Good night.

410
00:35:56,181 --> 00:36:00,781
Good night, sweet maiden of the golden ale.

411
00:36:01,081 --> 00:36:03,381
Mind who you're sweet-taking.

412
00:36:03,681 --> 00:36:07,982
Don't worry, Sam.
Rosie knows an idiot when she sees one.

413
00:36:09,182 --> 00:36:10,282
Does she?

414
00:36:10,982 --> 00:36:13,882
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Mr. Frodo.

415
00:36:38,783 --> 00:36:41,183
Is it secret? Is it safe?

416
00:36:50,183 --> 00:36:52,183
What are you doing?

417
00:37:04,884 --> 00:37:07,384
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

418
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:08,784
It's quite cool.

419
00:37:12,284 --> 00:37:13,984
What can you see?

420
00:37:15,884 --> 00:37:18,184
Can you see anything?

421
00:37:21,084 --> 00:37:22,384
Nothing.

422
00:37:22,984 --> 00:37:24,885
There's nothing.

423
00:37:26,185 --> 00:37:27,585
Wait.

424
00:37:31,685 --> 00:37:33,885
There are markings.

425
00:37:35,485 --> 00:37:38,785
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.

426
00:37:39,085 --> 00:37:41,485
There are few who can.

427
00:37:42,185 --> 00:37:46,785
The language is that of Mordor,
which I will not utter here.

428
00:37:47,685 --> 00:37:48,685
Mordor!

429
00:37:48,985 --> 00:37:50,886
In the common tongue, it says:

430
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:54,586
"One ring to rule them all...

431
00:37:54,986 --> 00:37:57,186
...One ring to find them...

432
00:37:57,486 --> 00:37:59,586
...One ring to bring them all...

433
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,886
...and in the darkness bind them."

434
00:38:04,686 --> 00:38:06,586
This is the One ring...

435
00:38:06,586 --> 00:38:11,886
...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron
in the fires of Mount Doom.

436
00:38:12,386 --> 00:38:16,187
Taken by Isildur from the hand of Sauron himself.

437
00:38:17,187 --> 00:38:19,587
Bilbo found it.

438
00:38:20,087 --> 00:38:21,987
- In Gollum's cave.
- Yes.

439
00:38:22,287 --> 00:38:26,687
For 60 years, the ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping...

440
00:38:27,087 --> 00:38:30,287
...prolonging his life, delaying old age.

441
00:38:31,087 --> 00:38:35,287
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.

442
00:38:35,687 --> 00:38:37,987
The ring has awoken.

443
00:38:38,287 --> 00:38:40,887
It's heard its master's call.

444
00:38:41,187 --> 00:38:44,888
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

445
00:38:50,788 --> 00:38:52,788
No, Frodo.

446
00:38:53,888 --> 00:38:57,088
The spirit of Sauron endured.

447
00:38:57,388 --> 00:39:02,488
His life force is bound to the ring,
and the ring survived.

448
00:39:02,988 --> 00:39:05,088
Sauron has returned.

449
00:39:06,188 --> 00:39:08,089
His orcs have multiplied.

450
00:39:08,489 --> 00:39:12,289
His fortress at Barad-dûr
is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.

451
00:39:12,589 --> 00:39:17,189
Sauron needs only this ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

452
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:19,589
He is seeking it.

453
00:39:19,889 --> 00:39:23,489
Seeking it - All his thought is bent on it.

454
00:39:23,989 --> 00:39:26,589
For the ring yearns above all else...

455
00:39:26,889 --> 00:39:30,189
...to return to the hand of its master.

456
00:39:30,589 --> 00:39:32,289
They are one...

457
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:35,390
...the ring and the Dark Lord.

458
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,790
Frodo...

459
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:39,090
...he must never find it.

460
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:40,390
All right.

461
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:44,990
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

462
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:47,890
No one knows it's here, do they?

463
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:54,790
Do they, Gandalf?

464
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:59,191
There is one other who knew
that Bilbo had the ring.

465
00:40:00,591 --> 00:40:03,391
I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum.

466
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:05,791
But the enemy found him first.

467
00:40:07,691 --> 00:40:10,091
I don't know how long they tortured him.

468
00:40:10,391 --> 00:40:14,691
But amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words:

469
00:40:14,991 --> 00:40:17,091
Shire!

470
00:40:17,391 --> 00:40:18,891
Baggins!

471
00:40:19,191 --> 00:40:20,991
Shire.

472
00:40:20,991 --> 00:40:23,891
Baggins.
But that would lead them here!

473
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:27,892
Who goes there?

474
00:40:29,692 --> 00:40:30,892
Take it, Gandalf!

475
00:40:31,392 --> 00:40:32,392
- Take it!
- No, Frodo.

476
00:40:32,392 --> 00:40:34,792
- You must take it!
- You cannot offer me this ring!

477
00:40:35,092 --> 00:40:38,292
- I'm giving it to you!
- Don't tempt me, Frodo!

478
00:40:39,992 --> 00:40:42,092
I dare not take it.

479
00:40:42,492 --> 00:40:44,892
Not even to keep it safe.

480
00:40:46,092 --> 00:40:48,092
Understand, Frodo...

481
00:40:48,792 --> 00:40:52,293
...I would use this ring from a desire to do good.

482
00:40:57,793 --> 00:41:03,293
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

483
00:41:04,193 --> 00:41:06,993
- But it cannot stay in the Shire!
- No.

484
00:41:08,993 --> 00:41:10,493
No, it can't.

485
00:41:15,894 --> 00:41:17,294
What must I do?

486
00:41:18,994 --> 00:41:22,294
- You must leave. And leave quickly.
- Where? Where do I go?

487
00:41:22,794 --> 00:41:25,894
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

488
00:41:26,294 --> 00:41:27,294
Bree.

489
00:41:27,594 --> 00:41:30,194
- What about you?
- I'll be waiting for you...

490
00:41:30,494 --> 00:41:32,894
...at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

491
00:41:33,194 --> 00:41:36,794
- And the ring will be safe there?
- I don't know, Frodo.

492
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:38,994
I don't have any answers.

493
00:41:40,594 --> 00:41:45,895
I must see the head of my order.
He is both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

494
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,395
He'll know what to do.

495
00:41:49,095 --> 00:41:51,795
You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

496
00:41:52,195 --> 00:41:54,595
That name is not safe outside the Shire.

497
00:41:55,295 --> 00:41:58,495
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

498
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:02,395
I can cut across country easily enough.

499
00:42:04,995 --> 00:42:06,295
My dear Frodo.

500
00:42:06,595 --> 00:42:09,596
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

501
00:42:09,596 --> 00:42:12,596
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

502
00:42:12,896 --> 00:42:15,196
And yet, after a hundred years...

503
00:42:15,496 --> 00:42:17,396
...they can still surprise you.

504
00:42:19,196 --> 00:42:20,496
Get down.

505
00:42:32,696 --> 00:42:35,997
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

506
00:42:36,397 --> 00:42:37,797
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.

507
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,697
I was just cutting the grass under
the window there...If you follow me.

508
00:42:41,097 --> 00:42:43,397
A little late for trimming the verge, don't you think?

509
00:42:43,697 --> 00:42:46,497
- I heard raised voices.
- What did you hear? Speak!

510
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:47,797
Nothing important.

511
00:42:48,397 --> 00:42:50,797
That is, I heard a good deal
about a ring, and a Dark Lord...

512
00:42:50,797 --> 00:42:52,497
...and something about the end of the world but...

513
00:42:52,497 --> 00:42:57,197
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

514
00:42:58,197 --> 00:42:59,698
No?

515
00:43:00,998 --> 00:43:02,098
Perhaps not.

516
00:43:03,398 --> 00:43:06,698
I've thought of a better use for you.

517
00:43:08,498 --> 00:43:11,398
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

518
00:43:13,098 --> 00:43:15,198
Be careful, both of you.

519
00:43:15,598 --> 00:43:18,198
The enemy has many spies in his service:

520
00:43:18,498 --> 00:43:21,298
Birds, beasts.

521
00:43:23,198 --> 00:43:24,999
Is it safe?

522
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:27,999
Never put it on...

523
00:43:28,299 --> 00:43:31,599
...for the agents of the Dark Lord
will be drawn to its power.

524
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:33,299
Always remember, Frodo...

525
00:43:33,899 --> 00:43:36,899
...the ring is trying to get back to its master.

526
00:43:37,499 --> 00:43:39,499
It wants to be found.

527
00:44:20,101 --> 00:44:22,201
This is it.

528
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,701
This is what?

529
00:44:25,101 --> 00:44:27,101
If I take one more step...

530
00:44:27,701 --> 00:44:31,401
...it'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

531
00:44:35,901 --> 00:44:37,301
Come on, Sam.

532
00:44:45,802 --> 00:44:47,602
Remember what Bilbo used to say:

533
00:44:48,202 --> 00:44:51,802
- "It's a dangerous business, Frodo."
- "Going out your door.

534
00:44:52,102 --> 00:44:56,402
You step onto the road,
and if you don't keep your feet...

535
00:44:56,702 --> 00:45:00,702
... there's no knowing where
you might be swept off to."

536
00:45:14,803 --> 00:45:16,503
Sam.

537
00:45:20,103 --> 00:45:21,203
Wood-elves.

538
00:45:34,904 --> 00:45:38,304
They're going to the harbor
beyond the White Towers.

539
00:45:39,004 --> 00:45:40,604
To the Grey Havens.

540
00:45:41,304 --> 00:45:43,304
They're leaving Middle-earth.

541
00:45:43,304 --> 00:45:45,604
Never to return.

542
00:45:48,604 --> 00:45:50,604
I don't know why...

543
00:45:51,504 --> 00:45:53,804
...it makes me sad.

544
00:45:55,904 --> 00:46:00,305
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty
great root sticking into my back.

545
00:46:01,305 --> 00:46:03,005
Just shut your eyes...

546
00:46:03,005 --> 00:46:05,805
...and imagine you're back in your own bed...

547
00:46:06,205 --> 00:46:10,005
...with a soft mattress and a lovely feather pillow.

548
00:46:19,405 --> 00:46:22,005
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.

549
00:46:22,005 --> 00:46:25,006
I'm never going to be able to sleep out here.

550
00:46:27,406 --> 00:46:29,706
Me neither, Sam.

551
00:46:58,307 --> 00:47:01,307
Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom.

552
00:47:01,607 --> 00:47:03,207
The hour grows late.

553
00:47:03,207 --> 00:47:06,807
And Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard...

554
00:47:07,307 --> 00:47:09,607
...seeking my counsel.

555
00:47:09,907 --> 00:47:13,707
For that is why you have come, is it not?

556
00:47:14,007 --> 00:47:15,207
My old friend.

557
00:47:15,607 --> 00:47:17,108
Saruman.

558
00:47:22,008 --> 00:47:24,908
- You are sure of this?
- Beyond any doubt.

559
00:47:25,808 --> 00:47:28,008
So the ring of power has been found.

560
00:47:28,308 --> 00:47:31,308
All these long years, it was in the Shire.

561
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:34,808
- Under my very nose.
- Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

562
00:47:35,508 --> 00:47:39,708
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

563
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:44,609
But we still have time.
Time enough to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

564
00:47:45,009 --> 00:47:46,409
Time?

565
00:47:47,509 --> 00:47:50,009
What time do you think we have?

566
00:47:50,509 --> 00:47:54,209
Sauron has regained much of his former strength.

567
00:47:54,609 --> 00:47:56,709
He cannot yet take physical form...

568
00:47:57,009 --> 00:47:59,609
...but his spirit has lost none of its potency.

569
00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:05,209
Concealed within his fortress,
the Lord of Mordor sees all.

570
00:48:06,009 --> 00:48:11,710
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh.

571
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:16,510
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

572
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:22,510
A great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.

573
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,410
The eye of Sauron.

574
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:28,210
He is gathering all evil to him.

575
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:30,410
Very soon, he'll have summoned an army...

576
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:33,511
...great enough for an assault upon Middle-earth.

577
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,211
You know this?

578
00:48:36,811 --> 00:48:38,311
How?

579
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:40,511
I have seen it.

580
00:48:41,011 --> 00:48:44,111
A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.

581
00:48:45,011 --> 00:48:46,411
Why?

582
00:48:46,911 --> 00:48:49,511
Why should we fear to use it?

583
00:48:52,311 --> 00:48:56,111
They are not all accounted for,
the lost seeing-stones.

584
00:48:56,411 --> 00:48:59,512
We do not know who else may be watching.

585
00:49:02,212 --> 00:49:04,912
The hour is later than you think.

586
00:49:04,912 --> 00:49:07,412
Sauron's forces are already moving.

587
00:49:09,712 --> 00:49:12,412
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

588
00:49:12,812 --> 00:49:13,812
The Nine?

589
00:49:13,812 --> 00:49:16,912
They crossed the river Isen on Midsummer's Eve...

590
00:49:17,312 --> 00:49:19,912
...disguised as riders in black.

591
00:49:20,212 --> 00:49:24,012
- They've reached the Shire?
- They will find the ring.

592
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:27,913
And kill the one who carries it.

593
00:49:28,413 --> 00:49:29,813
Frodo!

594
00:49:42,613 --> 00:49:46,813
You did not seriously think that a hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

595
00:49:47,713 --> 00:49:50,414
There are none who can.

596
00:49:53,014 --> 00:49:55,614
Against the power of Mordor...

597
00:49:56,014 --> 00:49:58,514
...there can be no victory.

598
00:50:00,614 --> 00:50:03,614
We must join with him, Gandalf.

599
00:50:05,014 --> 00:50:07,214
We must join with Sauron.

600
00:50:10,014 --> 00:50:12,514
It would be wise, my friend.

601
00:50:13,214 --> 00:50:14,614
Tell me...

602
00:50:14,614 --> 00:50:16,315
...friend...

603
00:50:16,815 --> 00:50:21,215
...when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness?

604
00:51:00,916 --> 00:51:02,516
I gave you the chance of...

605
00:51:03,716 --> 00:51:06,316
...aiding me willingly...

606
00:51:06,616 --> 00:51:10,617
...but you have elected the way of pain!

607
00:51:34,118 --> 00:51:35,518
Mr. Frodo?

608
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:37,918
Frodo? Frodo!

609
00:51:39,418 --> 00:51:42,518
- I thought I'd lost you.
- What are you taking about?

610
00:51:42,518 --> 00:51:45,618
- It's just something Gandalf said.
- What did he say?

611
00:51:46,618 --> 00:51:50,318
"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

612
00:51:50,818 --> 00:51:54,318
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?

613
00:51:57,318 --> 00:51:58,318
Frodo.

614
00:51:58,618 --> 00:52:00,819
- Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
- Hello, Frodo.

615
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:02,419
Get off him.

616
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:04,419
Come on, Frodo.

617
00:52:04,419 --> 00:52:06,419
What's the meaning of this?

618
00:52:06,919 --> 00:52:09,919
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

619
00:52:11,219 --> 00:52:13,319
You get back here!

620
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:15,619
Get out of my field!

621
00:52:15,919 --> 00:52:18,519
You'll know the devil if I catch up with you!

622
00:52:18,919 --> 00:52:21,719
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

623
00:52:22,019 --> 00:52:23,119
And some cabbages.

624
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:26,220
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

625
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:30,320
- And then the mushrooms the week before.
- Yes, Pippin. My point is...

626
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,820
...he's clearly overreacting.

627
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,520
Run!

628
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:50,521
Oh, that was close.

629
00:52:51,721 --> 00:52:54,721
I think I've broken something.

630
00:52:55,821 --> 00:52:58,121
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

631
00:52:58,121 --> 00:53:01,821
What? That was just a detour.
A short cut.

632
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:04,421
- Short cut to what?
- Mushrooms!

633
00:53:13,221 --> 00:53:14,621
That's mine.

634
00:53:17,422 --> 00:53:19,022
That's nice, Merry.

635
00:53:19,622 --> 00:53:21,622
Here's a nice one, Sam.

636
00:53:21,622 --> 00:53:24,222
I think we should get off the road.

637
00:53:33,622 --> 00:53:34,922
Get off the road!

638
00:53:34,922 --> 00:53:36,522
Quick!

639
00:53:49,323 --> 00:53:50,723
Be quiet!

640
00:54:57,125 --> 00:54:59,226
What was that?

641
00:55:32,027 --> 00:55:33,427
Anything?

642
00:55:34,227 --> 00:55:35,627
Nothing.

643
00:55:36,427 --> 00:55:38,627
What is going on?

644
00:55:39,227 --> 00:55:42,827
That Black Rider was looking for something.
Or someone.

645
00:55:44,327 --> 00:55:45,727
Frodo?

646
00:55:46,527 --> 00:55:47,527
Get down!

647
00:56:04,428 --> 00:56:06,628
I have to leave the Shire.

648
00:56:07,728 --> 00:56:10,028
Sam and I must get to Bree.

649
00:56:10,028 --> 00:56:11,628
Right.

650
00:56:13,028 --> 00:56:15,228
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

651
00:56:23,629 --> 00:56:24,829
Run!

652
00:56:26,129 --> 00:56:28,029
This way! Follow me!

653
00:56:31,829 --> 00:56:32,729
Run!

654
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:47,730
Get the rope, Sam!

655
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:51,930
Frodo!

656
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:54,030
Run, Frodo!

657
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:55,530
Go!
- Hurry!

658
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:58,230
Frodo, come on!

659
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:01,330
- Come on! Faster!
- Jump!

660
00:57:16,331 --> 00:57:20,331
- How far to the nearest crossing?
- The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.

661
00:57:35,132 --> 00:57:36,632
Come on.

662
00:57:47,832 --> 00:57:51,132
- What do you want?
- We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

663
00:57:54,732 --> 00:57:57,532
Hobbits. Four hobbits!

664
00:57:57,532 --> 00:58:01,533
What's more, out of the Shire by your talk.
What business brings you to Bree?

665
00:58:02,233 --> 00:58:05,233
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.

666
00:58:06,433 --> 00:58:08,833
All right young sir, I meant no offense.

667
00:58:09,133 --> 00:58:11,533
It's my job to ask questions after nightfall.

668
00:58:11,933 --> 00:58:14,733
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

669
00:58:14,733 --> 00:58:17,033
Can't be too careful.

670
00:58:36,834 --> 00:58:40,134
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

671
00:59:04,335 --> 00:59:05,835
Excuse me.

672
00:59:06,935 --> 00:59:09,635
Good evening, little masters.
What can I do for you?

673
00:59:09,935 --> 00:59:15,735
If you're looking for accommodation, we got
some nice cozy hobbit-sized rooms available.

674
00:59:16,236 --> 00:59:20,736
Always proud to cater to little folk, Mister...?

675
00:59:21,936 --> 00:59:23,936
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

676
00:59:25,336 --> 00:59:27,736
- Underhill, yeah.
- We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.

677
00:59:28,036 --> 00:59:31,036
- Can you tell him we've arrived?
- Gandalf?

678
00:59:31,536 --> 00:59:33,236
Gandalf.

679
00:59:34,136 --> 00:59:35,736
Oh, yes...

680
00:59:36,036 --> 00:59:38,036
...I remember. Elderly chap.

681
00:59:38,436 --> 00:59:41,336
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

682
00:59:41,737 --> 00:59:43,537
Not seen him for six months.

683
00:59:50,437 --> 00:59:51,737
What do we do now?

684
00:59:58,937 --> 01:00:00,137
Sam...

685
01:00:00,137 --> 01:00:02,137
...he'll be here. He'll come.

686
01:00:05,037 --> 01:00:07,037
Get out of my way!

687
01:00:09,538 --> 01:00:11,138
What's that?

688
01:00:11,138 --> 01:00:13,738
This, my friend, is a pint.

689
01:00:14,138 --> 01:00:15,638
It comes in pints?

690
01:00:16,038 --> 01:00:19,538
- I'm getting one.
- You got a whole half already!

691
01:00:26,038 --> 01:00:29,738
That fellow's done nothing but
stare at you since we arrived.

692
01:00:33,539 --> 01:00:34,939
Excuse me.

693
01:00:36,839 --> 01:00:39,639
That man in the corner. Who is he?

694
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:45,239
He's one of them Rangers. They're dangerous
folk they are, wandering the wilds.

695
01:00:45,539 --> 01:00:49,939
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but 'round here he's known as Strider.

696
01:00:52,439 --> 01:00:53,639
Strider.

697
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:09,840
<i>Baggins...</i>

698
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,940
<i>Baggins...</i>

699
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:22,640
<i>Baggins...</i>

700
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:26,341
<i>Baggins...</i>

701
01:01:27,041 --> 01:01:29,941
<i>Baggins...
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.</i>

702
01:01:30,641 --> 01:01:33,241
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

703
01:01:33,241 --> 01:01:36,541
He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...

704
01:01:36,541 --> 01:01:38,841
...and my third cousin, twice removed....

705
01:01:43,441 --> 01:01:45,141
- Pippin!
- Steady on, Frodo.

706
01:02:14,742 --> 01:02:17,143
<i>You cannot hide.</i>

707
01:02:20,143 --> 01:02:23,143
<i>I see you.</i>

708
01:02:25,043 --> 01:02:27,643
<i>There is no life...</i>

709
01:02:27,643 --> 01:02:29,943
<i>...in the void.</i>

710
01:02:30,243 --> 01:02:31,643
<i>Only...</i>

711
01:02:32,643 --> 01:02:34,143
<i>...death.</i>

712
01:02:40,143 --> 01:02:44,844
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

713
01:02:49,744 --> 01:02:50,644
What do you want?

714
01:02:50,944 --> 01:02:52,944
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

715
01:02:53,444 --> 01:02:56,344
- I carry nothing.
- Indeed.

716
01:02:56,744 --> 01:02:59,144
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

717
01:02:59,444 --> 01:03:02,944
...but to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift.

718
01:03:03,644 --> 01:03:06,144
- Who are you?
- Are you frightened?

719
01:03:07,545 --> 01:03:08,445
Yes.

720
01:03:08,445 --> 01:03:12,445
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

721
01:03:16,545 --> 01:03:18,945
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.

722
01:03:20,845 --> 01:03:24,745
You have a stout heart, little hobbit.
But that will not save you.

723
01:03:25,145 --> 01:03:27,945
You can no longer wait for the wizard, Frodo.

724
01:03:28,245 --> 01:03:29,245
They're coming.

725
01:04:52,949 --> 01:04:54,349
What are they?

726
01:04:56,549 --> 01:04:58,649
They were once men.

727
01:04:58,949 --> 01:05:01,049
Great kings of men.

728
01:05:01,649 --> 01:05:04,649
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

729
01:05:05,449 --> 01:05:08,449
Blinded by their greed,
they took them without question.

730
01:05:08,749 --> 01:05:11,949
One by one, falling into darkness.

731
01:05:12,249 --> 01:05:14,649
Now they are slaves to his will.

732
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:18,750
They are the Nazgûl.

733
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:21,550
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

734
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:23,950
At all times they feel...

735
01:05:23,950 --> 01:05:25,950
... the presence of the ring...

736
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:30,550
...drawn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.

737
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:43,551
- Where are you taking us?
- Into the wild.

738
01:05:51,951 --> 01:05:55,751
How can we know this Strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

739
01:05:56,151 --> 01:05:58,951
I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer...

740
01:05:59,351 --> 01:06:03,151
...and feel fouler.
- He's foul enough.

741
01:06:03,851 --> 01:06:06,651
We have no choice but to trust him.

742
01:06:06,951 --> 01:06:10,152
- But where is he leading us?
- To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.

743
01:06:12,652 --> 01:06:15,852
- To the house of Elrond.
- Did you hear that? Rivendell.

744
01:06:16,552 --> 01:06:19,252
We're going to see the elves.

745
01:06:40,953 --> 01:06:45,053
- Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
- What about breakfast?

746
01:06:45,353 --> 01:06:48,053
- You've already had it.
- We've had one, yes.

747
01:06:48,053 --> 01:06:50,453
What about second breakfast?

748
01:06:53,853 --> 01:06:56,853
Don't think he knows about second breakfast, Pip.

749
01:06:57,353 --> 01:07:02,354
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

750
01:07:02,754 --> 01:07:06,754
- He knows about them, doesn't he?
- I wouldn't count on it.

751
01:07:12,354 --> 01:07:13,954
Pippin!

752
01:07:30,455 --> 01:07:33,755
What do they eat when they can't get Hobbit?

753
01:07:49,255 --> 01:07:52,556
<i>"Tinúviel elvanui
(Tinúviel the elven-fair)</i>

754
01:07:54,456 --> 01:08:00,756
<i>Elleth alfirin ethelhael
(Immortal maiden elven-wise)</i>

755
01:08:02,156 --> 01:08:08,056
<i>O hon ring finnil fuinui
(About him cast her night-dark hair)</i>

756
01:08:08,556 --> 01:08:12,556
<i>A renc gelebrin thiliol."
(And arms like silver glimmering.")</i>

757
01:08:12,856 --> 01:08:14,956
Who is she?

758
01:08:15,756 --> 01:08:18,157
This woman you sing of.

759
01:08:21,657 --> 01:08:24,057
'Tis the Lay of Lúthien.

760
01:08:24,057 --> 01:08:29,257
The elf-maiden who gave her
love to Beren, a mortal.

761
01:08:31,257 --> 01:08:33,357
What happened to her?

762
01:08:35,657 --> 01:08:38,057
She died.

763
01:08:42,058 --> 01:08:44,358
Get some sleep, Frodo.

764
01:08:54,858 --> 01:08:58,758
The power of Isengard is at your command...

765
01:08:59,058 --> 01:09:03,258
... Sauron, Lord of the Earth.

766
01:09:06,858 --> 01:09:12,459
Build me an army worthy of Mordor.

767
01:09:18,159 --> 01:09:22,459
What orders from Mordor, my lord?
What does the Eye command?

768
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,959
We have work to do.

769
01:10:07,861 --> 01:10:12,261
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.

770
01:10:12,861 --> 01:10:14,661
Rip them all down.

771
01:10:42,162 --> 01:10:44,862
This was the great watchtower of Amon Sûl.

772
01:10:46,662 --> 01:10:49,162
We shall rest here tonight.

773
01:11:00,963 --> 01:11:04,263
These are for you.
Keep them close.

774
01:11:04,663 --> 01:11:07,063
I'm going to have a look around.

775
01:11:09,563 --> 01:11:11,363
Stay here.

776
01:11:13,963 --> 01:11:16,164
My tomato's burst.

777
01:11:16,164 --> 01:11:18,264
Could I have some bacon?

778
01:11:18,264 --> 01:11:20,364
Want a tomato, Sam?

779
01:11:20,764 --> 01:11:24,364
- What are you doing?!
- Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.

780
01:11:24,664 --> 01:11:27,264
- We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
- Put it out, you fools!

781
01:11:27,564 --> 01:11:31,364
- Put it out!
- That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

782
01:11:39,964 --> 01:11:41,665
Go!

783
01:12:35,267 --> 01:12:36,667
Back, you devils!

784
01:12:46,858 --> 01:12:48,827
[Black Speech] <i>Gûm-ishi...</i>

786
01:13:11,328 --> 01:13:13,328
[Black Speech] <i>...gurum!</i>
[English] ...death!

787
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:01,370
Frodo!

788
01:14:06,070 --> 01:14:07,270
Oh, Sam.

789
01:14:44,372 --> 01:14:45,372
Strider!

790
01:14:48,072 --> 01:14:53,372
- Help him, Strider.
- He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.

791
01:14:55,072 --> 01:14:59,772
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs elvish medicine.

792
01:15:04,572 --> 01:15:05,572
Hurry!

793
01:15:05,872 --> 01:15:09,673
We're six days from Rivendell!
He'll never make it!

794
01:15:09,973 --> 01:15:11,773
Hold on, Frodo.

795
01:15:12,373 --> 01:15:14,373
Gandalf!

796
01:16:17,835 --> 01:16:19,835
... Gwaihir, go!

797
01:17:52,579 --> 01:17:55,479
Look, Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.

798
01:17:57,779 --> 01:18:00,479
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

799
01:18:03,479 --> 01:18:05,179
Is he going to die?

800
01:18:05,479 --> 01:18:10,180
He's passing into the shadow world.
He'll soon become a wraith like them.

801
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:19,180
- They're close.
- Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?

802
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:20,980
- Athelas?
- Kingsfoil.

803
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:22,180
Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.

804
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:25,480
It may help to slow the poisoning.
Hurry!

805
01:18:39,981 --> 01:18:43,981
What's this, a ranger caught off his guard?

806
01:19:09,082 --> 01:19:10,382
Frodo.

807
01:19:11,532 --> 01:19:15,932
[Sindarin] <i>Im Arwen, Telin le thaed.</i>
[English] I Arwen, I come to help you.

808
01:19:17,182 --> 01:19:21,332
[Sindarin] <i>Lasto beth nîn, tolo dan nan galad.</i>
[English] Listen to my word, come back to the light.

809
01:19:26,883 --> 01:19:28,683
Who is she?

810
01:19:29,383 --> 01:19:31,083
Frodo.

811
01:19:31,383 --> 01:19:34,783
- She's an elf.
- He's fading.

812
01:19:37,383 --> 01:19:39,383
He's not going to last.

813
01:19:39,683 --> 01:19:42,183
We must get him to my father.

814
01:19:42,983 --> 01:19:45,783
- I've been looking for you for two days.
- Where are you taking him?

815
01:19:46,083 --> 01:19:51,984
There are five wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.

816
01:19:52,884 --> 01:19:55,604
[Sindarin] <i>Dartho guin Beriain. Rych le ad tolthathon.</i>
[English] Stay with the Hobbits. I will send horses for you.

817
01:19:55,604 --> 01:19:58,084
[Sindarin] <i>Hon mabathon! Rochon ellint im.</i>
[English] I will take him! I am the swifter rider.

818
01:19:58,084 --> 01:19:59,574
[Sindarin] <i>Andelu i ven.</i>
[English] The road is too dangerous.

819
01:19:59,984 --> 01:20:01,184
What are they saying?

820
01:20:00,974 --> 01:20:03,514
[Sindarin] <i>Frodo fîr. Ae athradon i hîr ...</i>
[English] Frodo is dying. If I cross the river ...

821
01:20:03,514 --> 01:20:06,734
[Sindarin] <i>... tûr gwaith nîn beriatha hon.</i>
[English] ... the power of my people will protect him.

822
01:20:07,384 --> 01:20:08,884
I do not fear them.

823
01:20:12,604 --> 01:20:13,564
[Sindarin] <i>Be iest lîn.</i>
[English] As you wish.

824
01:20:18,885 --> 01:20:20,285
Arwen...

825
01:20:20,285 --> 01:20:23,485
...ride hard. Don't Look back.

826
01:20:22,645 --> 01:20:24,835
[Sindarin] <i>Noro lim Asfaloth, noro lim!</i>
[English] Ride fast Asfaloth, ride fast!

827
01:20:28,685 --> 01:20:32,885
What are you doing?!
Those wraiths are still out there!

828
01:21:43,048 --> 01:21:44,848
[Sindarin] <i>Noro lim Asfaloth!</i>
[English] Ride fast Asfaloth!

829
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:30,990
Give up the halfling, She-elf.

830
01:22:31,390 --> 01:22:33,790
If you want him, come and claim him.

831
01:22:45,850 --> 01:22:48,370
[Sindarin] <i>Nîn o Chithaeglir, lasto beth daer!</i>
[English] Waters of the Misty Mountains, listen to the great word!

832
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:51,491

[English] Flow waters of Loudwater against the Ringwraiths!

01:22:51,491 --> 01:22:54,641
[Sindarin] <i>Nîn o Chithaeglir, lasto beth daer!</i>
[English] Waters of the Misty Mountains, listen to the great word!

834
01:22:54,641 --> 01:22:58,021
[Sindarin] <i>Rimmo nîn Bruinen dan in Ulaer!</i>
[English] Flow waters of Loudwater against the Ringwraiths!

835
01:23:27,792 --> 01:23:30,192
No. No!

836
01:23:33,492 --> 01:23:35,692
Frodo, no.

837
01:23:35,992 --> 01:23:38,192
Frodo, don't give in.

838
01:23:38,492 --> 01:23:40,392
Not now.

839
01:23:51,493 --> 01:23:53,893
What grace is given me...

840
01:23:54,593 --> 01:23:56,393
...let it pass to him.

841
01:23:56,693 --> 01:23:58,793
Let him be spared.

842
01:23:59,493 --> 01:24:01,393
Save him.

843
01:24:03,353 --> 01:24:07,444
[Sindarin] <i>Lasto beth nîn. Tolo dan nan galad.</i>
[English] Hear my voice. Come back to the light.

844
01:24:13,894 --> 01:24:18,894
- Where am I?
- You are in the house of Elrond.

845
01:24:19,494 --> 01:24:25,694
And it is 10 o'clock in the morning
on October 24th, if you want to know.

846
01:24:27,994 --> 01:24:31,594
- Gandalf!
- Yes, I'm here.

847
01:24:33,495 --> 01:24:36,395
And you're lucky to be here too.

848
01:24:37,095 --> 01:24:40,995
A few more hours and you would
have been beyond our aid.

849
01:24:41,395 --> 01:24:45,295
But you have some strength in you,
my dear Hobbit.

850
01:24:53,095 --> 01:24:55,495
What happened, Gandalf?

851
01:24:56,495 --> 01:25:01,796
- Why didn't you meet us?
- I am sorry, Frodo.

852
01:25:06,596 --> 01:25:08,296
I was delayed.

853
01:25:09,396 --> 01:25:13,396
A friendship with Saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.

854
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:22,196
One ill turn deserves another. It is over.

855
01:25:22,696 --> 01:25:25,297
Embrace the power of the ring...

856
01:25:25,997 --> 01:25:28,397
...or embrace your own destruction!

857
01:25:30,797 --> 01:25:34,497
There is only one lord of the ring.

858
01:25:34,997 --> 01:25:38,797
Only one who can bend it to his will.

859
01:25:39,797 --> 01:25:43,597
And he does not share power.

860
01:25:57,998 --> 01:26:01,198
So you have chosen...death.

861
01:26:11,498 --> 01:26:15,098
Gandalf? What is it?

862
01:26:16,299 --> 01:26:17,999
Nothing, Frodo.

863
01:26:18,699 --> 01:26:20,599
Frodo!

864
01:26:21,999 --> 01:26:24,199
- Sam.
- Bless you, you're awake!

865
01:26:24,599 --> 01:26:27,199
Sam has hardly left your side.

866
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:29,599
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

867
01:26:30,199 --> 01:26:35,099
By the skills of Lord Elrond,
you're beginning to mend.

868
01:26:36,699 --> 01:26:40,199
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

869
01:27:28,401 --> 01:27:31,501
- Bilbo!
- Hello, Frodo, my lad.

870
01:27:31,901 --> 01:27:33,602
Bilbo.

871
01:27:38,502 --> 01:27:40,502
There and back again

872
01:27:40,502 --> 01:27:43,202
A hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins.''

873
01:27:46,402 --> 01:27:49,802
- This is wonderful.
- I meant to go back...

874
01:27:50,202 --> 01:27:53,902
...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

875
01:27:54,502 --> 01:27:56,702
...visit Lake-town...

876
01:27:57,002 --> 01:28:00,303
...see the Lonely Mountain again.

877
01:28:01,003 --> 01:28:05,603
But age, it seems, has finally caught up with me.

878
01:28:18,003 --> 01:28:19,703
I miss the Shire.

879
01:28:20,203 --> 01:28:25,104
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

880
01:28:25,604 --> 01:28:29,004
Off with you, on one of your adventures.

881
01:28:32,004 --> 01:28:35,504
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

882
01:28:41,004 --> 01:28:44,004
I'm not like you, Bilbo.

883
01:28:45,404 --> 01:28:47,504
My dear boy.

884
01:28:51,805 --> 01:28:55,505
- Now, what have I forgotten?
- Packed already?

885
01:28:56,405 --> 01:28:58,105
No harm in being prepared.

886
01:28:58,405 --> 01:29:00,905
- I thought you wanted to see the elves.
- I do.

887
01:29:01,205 --> 01:29:03,905
- More than anything.
- I did.

888
01:29:04,305 --> 01:29:06,205
It's just....

889
01:29:07,005 --> 01:29:09,505
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

890
01:29:09,805 --> 01:29:13,305
We got the ring this far, to Rivendell.
And I thought...

891
01:29:13,805 --> 01:29:16,906
...seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

892
01:29:17,206 --> 01:29:18,806
Off home.

893
01:29:23,006 --> 01:29:24,906
You are right, Sam.

894
01:29:27,206 --> 01:29:29,906
We did what we set out to do.

895
01:29:30,506 --> 01:29:33,006
The ring will be safe in Rivendell.

896
01:29:37,206 --> 01:29:39,506
I am ready to go home.

897
01:29:40,306 --> 01:29:42,207
His strength returns.

898
01:29:42,507 --> 01:29:48,007
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

899
01:29:48,907 --> 01:29:51,307
And yet to have come so far still bearing the ring...

900
01:29:51,307 --> 01:29:55,107
...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

901
01:29:55,507 --> 01:29:58,807
It is a burden he should never have had to bear.

902
01:29:59,107 --> 01:30:04,307
- We can ask no more of Frodo.
- Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

903
01:30:04,707 --> 01:30:09,208
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His eye is fixed on Rivendell.

904
01:30:09,608 --> 01:30:12,208
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

905
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:15,708
Our list of allies grows thin.

906
01:30:16,508 --> 01:30:19,208
His treachery runs deeper than you know.

907
01:30:19,508 --> 01:30:23,008
By foul craft, Saruman
has crossed orcs with goblin-men.

908
01:30:23,408 --> 01:30:25,708
He's breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard.

909
01:30:26,108 --> 01:30:30,508
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

910
01:30:30,908 --> 01:30:33,209
Saruman is coming for the ring.

911
01:30:33,709 --> 01:30:37,609
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the elves.

912
01:30:38,009 --> 01:30:42,209
We do not have the strength to
fight both Mordor and Isengard!

913
01:30:46,209 --> 01:30:47,209
Gandalf...

914
01:30:48,609 --> 01:30:51,009
...the ring cannot stay here.

915
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:13,810
This peril belongs to all Middle-earth.

916
01:31:14,110 --> 01:31:16,810
They must decide now how to end it.

917
01:31:17,910 --> 01:31:21,310
The time of the elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.

918
01:31:22,110 --> 01:31:25,611
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The dwarves?

919
01:31:26,011 --> 01:31:30,911
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

920
01:31:32,611 --> 01:31:35,411
It is in men that we must place our hope.

921
01:31:35,911 --> 01:31:37,511
Men?

922
01:31:38,511 --> 01:31:41,511
Men are weak. The race of men is failing.

923
01:31:41,911 --> 01:31:46,111
The blood of Numenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

924
01:31:46,611 --> 01:31:50,011
It is because of men the ring survives.

925
01:31:50,412 --> 01:31:51,912
I was there, Gandalf.

926
01:31:52,712 --> 01:31:55,412
I was there 3000 years ago...

927
01:32:02,312 --> 01:32:04,612
... when Isildur took the ring.

928
01:32:04,912 --> 01:32:08,612
I was there the day the strength of men failed.

929
01:32:11,312 --> 01:32:13,812
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

930
01:32:15,512 --> 01:32:19,013
I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom...

931
01:32:19,413 --> 01:32:22,813
...where the ring was forged,
the one place it could be destroyed.

932
01:32:22,813 --> 01:32:25,513
Cast it into the fire!

933
01:32:30,813 --> 01:32:34,413
- Destroy it!
- No.

934
01:32:35,913 --> 01:32:38,013
Isildur!

935
01:32:38,513 --> 01:32:43,114
It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.

936
01:32:47,414 --> 01:32:51,514
Isildur kept the ring.
The line of kings is broken.

937
01:32:52,514 --> 01:32:56,114
There's no strength left in the world of men.

938
01:32:56,514 --> 01:33:01,114
- They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
- There is one who could unite them.

939
01:33:01,514 --> 01:33:04,714
One who could reclaim the throne of Gondor.

940
01:33:06,614 --> 01:33:10,215
He turned from that path a long time ago.

941
01:33:10,515 --> 01:33:12,615
He has chosen exile.

942
01:33:43,716 --> 01:33:45,616
You are no elf.

943
01:33:45,916 --> 01:33:47,916
Men of the South are welcome here.

944
01:33:48,616 --> 01:33:52,016
- Who are you?
- I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.

945
01:33:53,616 --> 01:33:56,316
Then we are here on common purpose...

946
01:33:56,716 --> 01:33:58,116
...friend.

947
01:34:13,517 --> 01:34:16,317
The shards of Narsil.

948
01:34:19,917 --> 01:34:24,117
The blade that cut the ring from Sauron's hand.

949
01:34:27,218 --> 01:34:29,418
It's still sharp.

950
01:34:38,418 --> 01:34:41,318
But no more than a broken heirloom.

951
01:35:08,319 --> 01:35:11,319
Why do you fear the past?

952
01:35:12,219 --> 01:35:17,320
You are Isildur's heir, not Isildur himseIf.

953
01:35:17,820 --> 01:35:21,120
You are not bound to his fate.

954
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:25,520
The same blood flows in my veins.

955
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:31,220
The same weakness.

956
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:36,720
Your time will come.

957
01:35:37,020 --> 01:35:41,220
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

958
01:35:44,081 --> 01:35:46,791
[Sindarin] <i>A si i-Dhúath ú-orthor, Aragorn.</i>
[English] The shadow does not hold sway yet, Aragorn.

959
01:35:47,781 --> 01:35:51,371
[Sindarin] <i>Ú or le a ú or nin.</i>
[English] Not over you, not over me.

960
01:36:02,531 --> 01:36:05,771
[Sindarin] <i>Renich i lú i erui govannem?</i>
[English] Do you remember when we first met?

961
01:36:09,262 --> 01:36:13,292
[Sindarin] <i>Nauthannen i ned ôl reniannen.</i>
[English] I thought I had strayed into a dream.

962
01:36:14,192 --> 01:36:16,872
[Sindarin] <i>Gwenwin in enninath.</i>
[English] Long years have passed.

963
01:36:17,912 --> 01:36:21,572
[Sindarin] <i>Ú-'arnech in naeth i si celich.</i>
[English] You did not wear the troubles you carry now.

964
01:36:23,412 --> 01:36:25,712
[Sindarin] <i>Renich i beth i pennen?</i>
[English] Do you remember what I told you?

965
01:36:31,922 --> 01:36:34,523
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

966
01:36:36,723 --> 01:36:41,423
...forsaking the immortal life of your people.

967
01:36:42,723 --> 01:36:44,623
And to that I hold.

968
01:36:44,623 --> 01:36:48,323
I would rather share one lifetime with you...

969
01:36:48,823 --> 01:36:52,423
...than face all the ages of this world alone.

970
01:37:01,324 --> 01:37:04,624
I choose a mortal life.

971
01:37:06,124 --> 01:37:10,224
- You cannot give me this.
- It is mine to give to whom I will...

972
01:37:13,624 --> 01:37:16,024
...like my heart.

973
01:37:31,925 --> 01:37:35,525
Strangers from distant lands, friends of old...

974
01:37:35,925 --> 01:37:39,625
...you've been summoned here
to answer the threat of Mordor.

975
01:37:40,425 --> 01:37:45,125
Middle-earth stands upon the brink of destruction.
None can escape it.

976
01:37:45,525 --> 01:37:48,925
You will unite, or you will fall.

977
01:37:49,325 --> 01:37:53,426
Each race is bound to this fate, this one doom.

978
01:37:55,426 --> 01:37:58,726
Bring forth the ring, Frodo.

979
01:38:13,026 --> 01:38:14,626
So it is true.

980
01:38:24,427 --> 01:38:25,927
<i>The ring of power...</i>

981
01:38:28,027 --> 01:38:29,527
<i>The doom of men...</i>

982
01:38:32,127 --> 01:38:34,127
In a dream...

983
01:38:35,927 --> 01:38:39,027
...I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

984
01:38:39,327 --> 01:38:41,027
...but in the West a pale light lingered.

985
01:38:41,828 --> 01:38:43,628
A voice was crying:

986
01:38:43,928 --> 01:38:46,728
"Your doom is near at hand.

987
01:38:47,928 --> 01:38:50,528
Isildur's bane is found."

988
01:38:52,658 --> 01:38:54,058
(The Ring)
[Black Speech] <i>Sherkuk-ishi</i>
[English] In your blood

989
01:38:54,528 --> 01:38:56,328
Isildur s bane.

990
01:38:56,928 --> 01:38:57,228
Boromir!

991
01:38:57,189 --> 01:39:00,958
(Gandalf)
[Black Speech] <i>Ash nazg durbatulûk...</i>
[English] One ring to rule them all...

992
01:38:58,538 --> 01:39:01,238
{\an8} (The Ring)
{\an8} [Black Speech] <i>Shre nazg golugranu kilmi-nudu...</i>
{\an8} [English] Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky...

993
01:39:00,958 --> 01:39:04,668
(Gandalf)
[Black Speech] <i>...Ash nazg gimbatul...</i>
[English] ...One ring to find them...

994
01:39:04,492 --> 01:39:08,755
{\an8} (The Ring)
{\an8} [Black Speech] <i>Ombi kuzd-durbagu... shirku</i>
{\an8} [English] Seven for the Dwarf-lords... blood

995
01:39:04,878 --> 01:39:08,049
(Gandalf)
[Black Speech] <i>...Ash nazg thrakatulûk...</i>
[English] ...One ring to bring them all...

996
01:39:09,073 --> 01:39:12,535
{\an8} (The Ring)
{\an8} [Black Speech] <i>Ash Burz-Durbagu burzum-ishi...</i>
{\an8} [English] One for the Dark lord on his dark throne...

997
01:39:10,959 --> 01:39:15,279
(Gandalf)
[Black Speech] <i>...Agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.</i>
[English] ...and in the darkness bind them.

998
01:39:21,429 --> 01:39:25,129
Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in Imladris.

999
01:39:25,529 --> 01:39:29,029
I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond...

1000
01:39:29,329 --> 01:39:31,329
...for the black speech of Mordor...

1001
01:39:31,729 --> 01:39:33,029
...may yet be heard...

1002
01:39:33,330 --> 01:39:36,130
...in every corner of the West!

1003
01:39:36,430 --> 01:39:39,030
The ring is altogether evil.

1004
01:39:39,530 --> 01:39:40,930
It is a gift.

1005
01:39:41,730 --> 01:39:43,630
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

1006
01:39:44,330 --> 01:39:46,330
Why not use this ring?

1007
01:39:46,630 --> 01:39:49,330
Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor...

1008
01:39:49,630 --> 01:39:53,730
...kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

1009
01:39:54,230 --> 01:39:56,330
...are your lands kept safe.

1010
01:39:58,130 --> 01:40:02,331
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

1011
01:40:02,731 --> 01:40:06,331
You cannot wield it. None of us can.

1012
01:40:07,131 --> 01:40:11,031
The one ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

1013
01:40:11,431 --> 01:40:14,831
And what would a ranger know of this matter?

1014
01:40:15,131 --> 01:40:17,031
This is no mere ranger.

1015
01:40:18,131 --> 01:40:21,631
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

1016
01:40:22,331 --> 01:40:25,132
You owe him your allegiance.

1017
01:40:29,332 --> 01:40:31,232
Aragorn.

1018
01:40:33,032 --> 01:40:35,832
This is Isildur s heir?

1019
01:40:38,232 --> 01:40:40,932
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

1020
01:40:42,412 --> 01:40:44,312
[Sindarin] <i>Havo dad, Legolas.</i>
[English] Sit down, Legolas.

1021
01:40:47,832 --> 01:40:50,633
Gondor has no king.

1022
01:40:52,633 --> 01:40:54,233
Gondor needs no king.

1023
01:41:00,933 --> 01:41:04,433
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

1024
01:41:05,633 --> 01:41:08,933
You have only one choice.

1025
01:41:09,233 --> 01:41:11,533
The ring must be destroyed.

1026
01:41:16,834 --> 01:41:19,334
What are we waiting for?

1027
01:41:24,584 --> 01:41:29,696
[Black Speech] <i>Daghburz-ishi makha, ghurarmu shirku.</i>
[English] In the land of Mordor, a sacrifice of blood.

1028
01:41:31,534 --> 01:41:34,434
The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin...

1029
01:41:34,834 --> 01:41:38,934
...by any craft that we here possess.

1030
01:41:39,634 --> 01:41:43,535
The ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom.

1031
01:41:44,035 --> 01:41:47,635
Only there can it be unmade.

1032
01:41:48,935 --> 01:41:51,335
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

1033
01:41:51,635 --> 01:41:55,935
...and cast back into the fiery
chasm from whence it came.

1034
01:41:55,340 --> 01:41:58,375
[Black Speech] <i>Makha gulshu darulu.</i>
[English] Where the Shadows lie.

1035
01:41:58,435 --> 01:42:00,535
One of you...

1036
01:42:01,135 --> 01:42:03,235
...must do this.

1037
01:42:06,235 --> 01:42:09,836
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

1038
01:42:10,836 --> 01:42:14,336
Its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs.

1039
01:42:15,236 --> 01:42:19,236
There is evil there that does not sleep.

1040
01:42:19,636 --> 01:42:23,736
The great eye is ever-watchful.

1041
01:42:24,636 --> 01:42:26,536
It is a barren wasteland...

1042
01:42:26,936 --> 01:42:30,236
...riddled with fire, and ash and dust.

1043
01:42:30,636 --> 01:42:34,437
The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume.

1044
01:42:34,737 --> 01:42:38,837
Not with 10,000 men could you do this.
It is folly.

1045
01:42:39,237 --> 01:42:43,537
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said?
The ring must be destroyed.

1046
01:42:43,937 --> 01:42:46,337
And I suppose you think you are the one to do it!

1047
01:42:46,637 --> 01:42:51,137
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

1048
01:42:51,537 --> 01:42:56,637
I will be dead before I see the
ring in the hands of an elf!

1049
01:42:58,837 --> 01:43:01,238
Never trust an elf!

1050
01:43:02,538 --> 01:43:08,138
Do you not understand? While you bicker
amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows!

1051
01:43:08,638 --> 01:43:11,438
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

1052
01:43:11,988 --> 01:43:14,768
[Black Speech] <i>Ash nazg durbatulûk...</i>
[English] One ring to rule them all...

1053
01:43:14,768 --> 01:43:17,278
[Black Speech] <i>...Ash nazg gimbatul.</i>
[English] ...One ring to find them.

1054
01:43:17,288 --> 01:43:19,378
[Black Speech] <i>Ash nazg durbatulûk...</i>
[English] One ring to rule them all...

1055
01:43:19,388 --> 01:43:21,488
[Black Speech] <i>...Ash nazg gimbatul.</i>
[English] ...One ring to find them.

1056
01:43:21,488 --> 01:43:23,478
[Black Speech] <i>Ash nazg durbatulûk...</i>
[English] One ring to rule them all...

1057
01:43:23,488 --> 01:43:25,689
[Black Speech] <i>...Ash nazg gimbatul.</i>
[English] ...One ring to find them.

1058
01:43:25,689 --> 01:43:27,589
[Black Speech] <i>Ash nazg durbatulûk...</i>
[English] One ring to rule them all...

1059
01:43:30,239 --> 01:43:32,239
I will take it.

1060
01:43:34,539 --> 01:43:37,039
I will take it.

1061
01:43:42,839 --> 01:43:45,839
I will take the ring to Mordor.

1062
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:55,240
Though...

1063
01:43:58,440 --> 01:44:00,240
...I do not know the way.

1064
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:06,340
I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins...

1065
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:10,040
...as long as it is yours to bear.

1066
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:14,240
If by my life or death I can protect you...

1067
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:16,341
...I will.

1068
01:44:19,641 --> 01:44:21,841
You have my sword.

1069
01:44:23,741 --> 01:44:25,741
And you have my bow.

1070
01:44:26,441 --> 01:44:28,741
And my ax.

1071
01:44:35,941 --> 01:44:38,741
You carry the fates of us all, little one.

1072
01:44:40,941 --> 01:44:44,442
If this is indeed the will of the Council...

1073
01:44:45,142 --> 01:44:47,542
...then Gondor will see it done.

1074
01:44:50,142 --> 01:44:54,742
- Mr. Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
- No indeed it is hardly possible to separate you...

1075
01:44:55,142 --> 01:44:59,842
...even when he is summoned to a
secret council and you are not.

1076
01:45:00,542 --> 01:45:02,342
Oy. We're coming too!

1077
01:45:04,542 --> 01:45:07,242
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

1078
01:45:07,242 --> 01:45:10,643
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

1079
01:45:11,143 --> 01:45:12,343
...mission.

1080
01:45:12,343 --> 01:45:13,893
Quest.

1081
01:45:14,393 --> 01:45:15,393
Thing.

1082
01:45:17,193 --> 01:45:19,893
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

1083
01:45:21,593 --> 01:45:23,393
Nine companions.

1084
01:45:25,193 --> 01:45:26,993
So be it.

1085
01:45:27,393 --> 01:45:30,393
You shall be: The Fellowship of the Ring.

1086
01:45:31,093 --> 01:45:32,893
Great!

1087
01:45:33,294 --> 01:45:35,394
Where are we going?
