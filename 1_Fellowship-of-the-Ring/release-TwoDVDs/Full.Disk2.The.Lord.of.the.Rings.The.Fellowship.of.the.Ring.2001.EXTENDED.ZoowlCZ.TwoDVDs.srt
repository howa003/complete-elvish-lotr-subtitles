00:00:10,618 --> 00:00:23,620
{\an8} [Sindarin] ♫ <i>Estel, le iôn adar lín...</i> ♫
{\an8} [English] ♫ Hope, you are your father’s son... ♫

3
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:33,520
{\an8} [Sindarin] ♫ <i>... û iôn naneth lín.</i> ♫
{\an8} [English] ♫ ... not your mother’s child. ♫

4
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,535
[Sindarin] <i>Anirne hene beriad i chên lîn.</i>
[English] She wanted to protect her child.

5
00:00:38,454 --> 00:00:42,249
[Sindarin] <i>Ned Imladris nauthant e le beriathar aen.</i>
[English] She thought in Rivendell you would be safe.

6
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:48,512
In her heart, your mother knew
you'd be hunted all your life.

7
00:00:49,112 --> 00:00:50,812
That you'd never escape your fate.

8
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:54,712
The skill of the elves can reforge
the sword of kings...

9
00:00:55,412 --> 00:00:59,113
...but only you have the power to wield it.

10
00:01:00,313 --> 00:01:02,713
I do not want that power.

11
00:01:03,013 --> 00:01:05,613
I have never wanted it.

12
00:01:06,914 --> 00:01:09,414
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

13
00:01:14,114 --> 00:01:16,314
My old sword! Sting.

14
00:01:16,714 --> 00:01:17,815
Here, take it. Take it.

15
00:01:23,215 --> 00:01:27,015
- It's so light.
- Yes, yeah. Made by the elves, you know.

16
00:01:27,815 --> 00:01:31,816
The blade glows blue when orcs are close.

17
00:01:32,316 --> 00:01:36,716
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

18
00:01:37,016 --> 00:01:39,416
Here's a pretty thing.

19
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:41,117
Mithril.

20
00:01:42,017 --> 00:01:46,217
As light as a feather, and as hard as dragon scales.

21
00:01:46,617 --> 00:01:49,717
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

22
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,918
My old ring.

23
00:02:01,218 --> 00:02:05,019
I should very much like...

24
00:02:05,419 --> 00:02:09,219
...to hold it again, one last time.

25
00:02:26,721 --> 00:02:30,221
I'm sorry I brought this upon you, my boy.

26
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:34,622
I'm sorry that you must carry this burden.

27
00:02:39,422 --> 00:02:42,322
I'm sorry for everything.

28
00:02:57,324 --> 00:03:01,524
The ring-bearer is setting out
on the quest of Mount Doom.

29
00:03:02,924 --> 00:03:05,424
On you who travel with him, no oath...

30
00:03:05,824 --> 00:03:08,825
...nor bond is laid to go further than you will.

31
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,725
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

32
00:03:15,225 --> 00:03:19,026
May the blessings of elves and men...

33
00:03:19,826 --> 00:03:22,326
...and all free folk go with you.

34
00:03:25,426 --> 00:03:29,327
The fellowship awaits the ring-bearer.

35
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:50,429
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

36
00:03:51,029 --> 00:03:52,829
Left.

37
00:05:12,536 --> 00:05:16,636
We must hold to this course, west
of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.

38
00:05:17,137 --> 00:05:20,637
If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.

39
00:05:21,137 --> 00:05:24,637
From there, our road turns east to Mordor.

40
00:05:24,637 --> 00:05:28,538
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

41
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,538
Move your feet.

42
00:05:31,538 --> 00:05:33,038
- You look good, Pippin.
- Thanks.

43
00:05:33,338 --> 00:05:34,738
Faster!

44
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:39,739
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

45
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:42,639
...I'd say we were taking the long way 'round.

46
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:46,239
Gandalf.
We could pass through the mines of Moria.

47
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:50,640
My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.

48
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,240
No Gimli, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

49
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:06,841
Sorry!

50
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,041
Get him!

51
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,842
- For the Shire!
- Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

52
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:15,742
Gentlemen, that's enough.

53
00:06:19,642 --> 00:06:21,142
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

54
00:06:21,642 --> 00:06:24,243
- What is that?
- Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

55
00:06:24,643 --> 00:06:27,143
It's moving fast.

56
00:06:27,543 --> 00:06:29,643
Against the wind.

57
00:06:30,443 --> 00:06:32,543
- Crebain from Dunland!
- Hide!

58
00:06:32,843 --> 00:06:35,444
- Hurry!
- Take cover!

59
00:07:09,047 --> 00:07:10,647
Spies of Saruman.

60
00:07:11,447 --> 00:07:14,547
The passage south is being watched.

61
00:07:15,847 --> 00:07:19,148
We must take the pass of Caradhras.

62
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:33,349
Frodo!

63
00:07:51,061 --> 00:07:58,171
{\an8} [Quenya] ♫ <i>I tuo, i macil...</i> ♫
{\an8} [English] ♫ The strength, The weapon... ♫

64
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:54,651
Boromir.

65
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:59,151
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

66
00:07:58,195 --> 00:08:04,420
{\an8} [Quenya] ♫ <i>Astaldoron mauri...</i> ♫
{\an8} [English] ♫ The needs of the valiant... ♫

67
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:02,352
...over so small a thing.

68
00:08:04,444 --> 00:08:07,298
{\an8} [Quenya] ♫ <i>Nai túren...</i> ♫
{\an8} [English] ♫ Be it that wictory... ♫

69
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,652
Such a little thing.

70
00:08:07,952 --> 00:08:09,352
Boromir!

71
00:08:10,052 --> 00:08:12,553
Give the ring to Frodo.

72
00:08:22,554 --> 00:08:24,454
As you wish.

73
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,254
I care not.

74
00:09:02,657 --> 00:09:07,158
So, Gandalf, you try to lead them over Caradhras.

75
00:09:07,558 --> 00:09:12,058
And if that fails, where then will you go?

76
00:09:13,558 --> 00:09:16,359
If the mountain defeats you...

77
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:20,959
... will you risk a more dangerous road?

78
00:09:28,473 --> 00:09:32,642
[Quenya] <i>Cuiva nwalca Carnirassë!</i>
[English] Wake up cruel Redhorn!

79
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,260
There is a fell voice on the air.

80
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,961
It's Saruman!

81
00:09:47,961 --> 00:09:52,362
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

82
00:09:52,762 --> 00:09:54,562
No!

83
00:09:56,672 --> 00:10:00,453
[Sindarin] <i>Losto Caradhras, Sedho! Hodo!</i>
[English] Sleep Redhorn, Be still! Lie Still!

84
00:10:00,973 --> 00:10:02,523
[Sindarin] <i>Nuitho i 'Ruith!</i>
[English] Hold your Wrath!

85
00:10:02,973 --> 00:10:08,003
[Quenya] <i>Cuiva nwalca Carnirassë!</i>
[English] Wake up cruel Redhorn!

86
00:10:08,673 --> 00:10:11,334
[Quenya] <i>Nai yarvaxëa rasselya...</i>
[English] May your bloodstained horn...

87
00:10:12,174 --> 00:10:15,474
[Quenya] <i>...taltuva ñotto-carinnar!</i>
[English] ...fall upon enemy heads!

88
00:11:01,068 --> 00:11:02,868
We must get off the mountain!

89
00:11:03,368 --> 00:11:07,569
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

90
00:11:07,969 --> 00:11:11,169
The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard!

91
00:11:11,469 --> 00:11:15,069
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

92
00:11:15,469 --> 00:11:18,170
Let us go through the mines of Moria.

93
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:23,670
Moria. You fear to go into those mines.

94
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:29,371
The dwarves delved too greedily and too deep.

95
00:11:30,471 --> 00:11:35,171
You know what they awoke
in the darkness of Khazad-dûm:

96
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:39,872
Shadow and flame.

97
00:11:43,472 --> 00:11:46,072
Let the ring-bearer decide.

98
00:11:50,873 --> 00:11:52,973
We cannot stay here!

99
00:11:52,973 --> 00:11:55,873
This will be the death of the hobbits.

100
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,773
Frodo?

101
00:12:00,874 --> 00:12:03,574
We will go through the mines.

102
00:12:04,574 --> 00:12:06,374
So be it.

103
00:12:13,075 --> 00:12:16,775
Frodo, come and help an old man.

104
00:12:20,475 --> 00:12:22,576
How is your shoulder?

105
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:25,976
- Better than it was.
- And the ring?

106
00:12:27,676 --> 00:12:30,176
You feel its power growing, don't you?

107
00:12:30,676 --> 00:12:33,477
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

108
00:12:34,077 --> 00:12:37,777
Evil will be drawn to you from
outside the fellowship.

109
00:12:38,077 --> 00:12:40,577
And, I fear, from within.

110
00:12:43,378 --> 00:12:47,378
- Who then do I trust?
- You must trust yourself.

111
00:12:47,678 --> 00:12:50,378
Trust your own strengths.

112
00:12:50,778 --> 00:12:53,278
- What do you mean?
- There are many powers in this world...

113
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:55,479
...for good or for evil.

114
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:57,979
Some are greater than I am.

115
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:01,979
And against some I have not yet been tested.

116
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:04,880
The walls...

117
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,680
...of Moria.

118
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,381
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

119
00:13:16,681 --> 00:13:20,881
Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

120
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:23,881
Why doesn't that surprise me?

121
00:13:31,882 --> 00:13:35,082
Well, let's see.

122
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:36,882
Ithildin.

123
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,783
It mirrors only starlight and moonlight.

124
00:13:54,984 --> 00:13:59,385
It reads; "The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria.

125
00:13:59,685 --> 00:14:04,385
- Speak, friend, and enter."
- What do you suppose that means?

126
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:09,085
Oh It's quite simple. If you are a friend,
you speak the password and the doors will open.

127
00:14:09,171 --> 00:14:13,834
[Sindarin] <i>Annon Edhellen edro hi ammen!</i>
[English] Gate of the elves, open now for me!

128
00:14:21,757 --> 00:14:28,157
[Sindarin] <i>Fennas Nogothrim, lasto beth lammen.</i>
[English] Doorway of the Dwarf-folk, listen to the word of my tongue.

129
00:14:32,988 --> 00:14:33,988
Nothing's happening.

130
00:14:41,188 --> 00:14:45,189
I once knew every spell in
all the tongues of elves...

131
00:14:45,689 --> 00:14:48,389
...men and orcs.

132
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:49,889
What are you going to do, then?

133
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,289
Knock your head against these doors,
Peregrin Took!

134
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:54,490
And if that does not shatter them...

135
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,390
...and I am allowed a little
peace from foolish questions...

136
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,990
...I will try to find the opening words.

137
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,401
[Quenya] <i>Ando Eldarinwa...</i>
[English] Gate of elves...

138
00:15:07,901 --> 00:15:09,901
[Quenya] <i>...a lasta quettanya...</i>
[English] ...listen to my word...

139
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,001
[Quenya] <i>...fenda casarinwa!</i>
[English] ...threshold of dwarves!

140
00:15:13,991 --> 00:15:16,392
Mines are no place for a pony.

141
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:20,592
- Even one so brave as Bill.
- Bye-bye, Bill.

142
00:15:20,592 --> 00:15:21,992
Fennas Nogothrim...
(Doorway of the dwarf-folk...)

143
00:15:21,992 --> 00:15:24,692
Go on, Bill. Go on.

144
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:28,893
Don't worry, Sam, he knows the way home.

145
00:15:35,793 --> 00:15:38,194
Do not disturb the water.

146
00:15:38,494 --> 00:15:40,394
Oh, it's useless.

147
00:15:53,095 --> 00:15:55,195
It's a riddle.

148
00:15:57,995 --> 00:16:01,096
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

149
00:16:01,596 --> 00:16:04,396
What's the elvish word for "friend"?

150
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,633
[Sindarin] Mellon.
[English] Friend.

151
00:16:05,796 --> 00:16:07,096
Mellon.

152
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,898
Soon, master elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the dwarves.

153
00:16:30,498 --> 00:16:35,999
Roaring fires, malt beer, ripe meat off the bone!

154
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:40,699
This, my friend, is the home of my cousin Balin.

155
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:43,600
And they call it a mine.

156
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,700
A mine!

157
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,000
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

158
00:16:56,301 --> 00:16:57,801
No....

159
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,701
No!

160
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:04,902
Goblins.

161
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:13,002
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

162
00:17:14,202 --> 00:17:16,703
Now, get out of here. Get out!

163
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:21,903
- Frodo!
- Help!

164
00:17:22,303 --> 00:17:23,803
Strider!

165
00:17:23,803 --> 00:17:26,604
- Help!
- Get off him!

166
00:17:26,904 --> 00:17:27,904
Aragorn!

167
00:17:38,405 --> 00:17:39,405
Frodo!

168
00:18:05,707 --> 00:18:06,807
Into the mines!

169
00:18:06,807 --> 00:18:10,108
- Legolas!
- Into the cave!

170
00:18:14,508 --> 00:18:16,208
Run!

171
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,710
We now have but one choice.

172
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:41,610
We must face the long dark of Moria.

173
00:18:42,111 --> 00:18:44,011
Be on your guard.

174
00:18:44,311 --> 00:18:47,611
There are older and fouler things than orcs...

175
00:18:48,011 --> 00:18:51,311
...in the deep places of the world.

176
00:18:59,412 --> 00:19:03,112
Quietly now.
It's a four-day journey to the other side.

177
00:19:03,613 --> 00:19:07,213
Let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed.

178
00:19:53,117 --> 00:19:56,717
The wealth of Moria was not in gold...

179
00:19:57,117 --> 00:19:59,418
...or jewels...

180
00:19:59,418 --> 00:20:02,618
...but mithril.

181
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,720
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

182
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,020
- Oh, that was a kingly gift.
- Yes.

183
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,121
I never told him...

184
00:20:32,421 --> 00:20:37,121
...but its worth was greater
than the value of the Shire.

185
00:20:49,622 --> 00:20:51,322
Pippin.

186
00:21:11,724 --> 00:21:14,525
I have no memory of this place.

187
00:21:16,725 --> 00:21:18,125
- Are we Lost?
- No.

188
00:21:18,425 --> 00:21:20,825
- I think we are.
- Gandalf's thinking.

189
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,525
- Merry?
- What?

190
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:24,625
I'm hungry.

191
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:40,327
- There's something down there.
- It's Gollum.

192
00:21:40,727 --> 00:21:44,627
- Gollum?
- He's been following us for three days.

193
00:21:45,127 --> 00:21:49,128
- He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?
- Escaped...

194
00:21:49,928 --> 00:21:51,528
...or was set loose.

195
00:21:52,128 --> 00:21:55,628
Now the ring has brought him here.

196
00:21:58,329 --> 00:22:01,029
He will never be rid of his need for it.

197
00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:06,829
He hates and loves the ring,
as he hates and loves himseIf.

198
00:22:07,229 --> 00:22:11,930
Smeagol's life is a sad story.

199
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:18,030
Yes, Smeagol he was once called.
Before the ring found him.

200
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:21,931
Before it drove him mad.

201
00:22:22,231 --> 00:22:25,031
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

202
00:22:25,331 --> 00:22:26,431
Pity?

203
00:22:27,531 --> 00:22:30,432
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

204
00:22:31,432 --> 00:22:36,432
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

205
00:22:38,132 --> 00:22:40,532
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

206
00:22:43,033 --> 00:22:46,833
Do not be too eager to deal
out death and judgment.

207
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:49,933
Even the very wise cannot see all ends.

208
00:22:50,633 --> 00:22:56,334
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

209
00:22:57,434 --> 00:23:00,134
...before this is over.

210
00:23:01,734 --> 00:23:05,435
The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.

211
00:23:12,335 --> 00:23:15,536
I wish the ring had never come to me.

212
00:23:17,036 --> 00:23:19,036
I wish none of this had happened.

213
00:23:19,036 --> 00:23:24,036
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

214
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:30,437
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

215
00:23:32,137 --> 00:23:35,938
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

216
00:23:36,538 --> 00:23:38,938
Bilbo was meant to find the ring.

217
00:23:39,438 --> 00:23:43,638
In which case, you also were meant to have it.

218
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:47,039
And that is an encouraging thought.

219
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:53,939
It's that way.

220
00:23:54,239 --> 00:23:56,439
- He's remembered.
- No.

221
00:23:56,739 --> 00:24:00,340
But the air doesn't smell so foul down here.

222
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,640
If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose.

223
00:24:20,742 --> 00:24:24,742
Let me risk a little more light.

224
00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:31,543
Behold...

225
00:24:32,043 --> 00:24:37,143
...the great realm and dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

226
00:24:39,743 --> 00:24:43,044
Now there's an eye opener, and no mistake.

227
00:25:08,146 --> 00:25:09,846
Gimli!

228
00:25:17,247 --> 00:25:18,847
No!

229
00:25:21,447 --> 00:25:24,548
Oh, no.

230
00:25:26,448 --> 00:25:27,648
No.

231
00:25:35,048 --> 00:25:36,949
"Here lies Balin...

232
00:25:37,449 --> 00:25:39,449
...son of Fundin...

233
00:25:39,849 --> 00:25:42,349
...Lord of Moria."

234
00:25:43,449 --> 00:25:45,049
He is dead, then.

235
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,550
It's as I feared.

236
00:26:06,851 --> 00:26:09,652
We must move on. We cannot linger.

237
00:26:09,952 --> 00:26:14,452
"They have taken the bridge and the second hall.

238
00:26:15,752 --> 00:26:18,252
We have barred the gates...

239
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:21,353
...but cannot hold them for long.

240
00:26:21,653 --> 00:26:24,353
The ground shakes.

241
00:26:24,953 --> 00:26:26,353
Drums...

242
00:26:26,853 --> 00:26:30,054
...drums in the deep.

243
00:26:33,854 --> 00:26:35,754
We cannot get out.

244
00:26:37,854 --> 00:26:41,555
A shadow moves in the dark.

245
00:26:43,355 --> 00:26:45,855
We cannot get out.

246
00:26:48,955 --> 00:26:50,755
They are coming."

247
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:35,760
Fool of a Took!

248
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,760
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

249
00:28:05,962 --> 00:28:07,563
Frodo!

250
00:28:09,963 --> 00:28:11,363
Orcs.

251
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:20,364
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

252
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,365
They have a cave-troll.

253
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:46,366
Let them come!

254
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:50,166
There is one dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

255
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,979
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

256
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,480
Frodo!

257
00:31:51,983 --> 00:31:53,783
Aragorn! Aragorn!

258
00:31:54,883 --> 00:31:56,684
Frodo!

259
00:32:41,888 --> 00:32:43,788
Frodo!

260
00:33:44,093 --> 00:33:45,394
Oh, no.

261
00:33:53,794 --> 00:33:55,595
He's alive.

262
00:33:58,195 --> 00:34:00,995
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

263
00:34:01,295 --> 00:34:03,395
You should be dead.

264
00:34:03,795 --> 00:34:06,095
That spear would have skewered a wild boar.

265
00:34:06,396 --> 00:34:10,996
I think there's more to this
hobbit than meets the eye.

266
00:34:16,996 --> 00:34:18,097
Mithril.

267
00:34:20,897 --> 00:34:23,397
You are full of surprises, Master Baggins.

268
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:31,198
To the bridge of Khazad-dûm!

269
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:47,999
This way!

270
00:35:58,506 --> 00:36:01,306
What is this new devilry?

271
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,308
A Balrog.

272
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:23,708
A demon of the ancient world.

273
00:36:26,008 --> 00:36:28,309
This foe is beyond any of you.

274
00:36:29,609 --> 00:36:31,109
Run!

275
00:36:38,409 --> 00:36:39,910
Quickly!

276
00:36:56,611 --> 00:36:57,911
Gandalf.

277
00:36:58,511 --> 00:37:00,011
Lead them on, Aragorn.

278
00:37:01,512 --> 00:37:04,012
The bridge is near.

279
00:37:06,012 --> 00:37:10,012
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

280
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,915
Gandalf!

281
00:37:59,317 --> 00:38:00,517
Merry! Pippin!

282
00:38:11,718 --> 00:38:13,118
Sam!

283
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:19,019
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

284
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:23,619
Not the beard!

285
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,821
Steady.

286
00:38:40,821 --> 00:38:42,421
Hold on!

287
00:39:03,623 --> 00:39:04,823
Hang on!

288
00:39:15,524 --> 00:39:17,224
Lean forward!

289
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:21,224
Steady.

290
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:23,725
Come on!

291
00:39:24,025 --> 00:39:25,425
Now!

292
00:39:42,626 --> 00:39:44,327
Over the bridge!

293
00:39:44,627 --> 00:39:46,127
Fly!

294
00:40:30,831 --> 00:40:32,831
You cannot pass!

295
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:34,731
Gandalf!

296
00:40:39,032 --> 00:40:43,732
I am a servant of the secret fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

297
00:40:44,832 --> 00:40:48,532
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!

298
00:40:58,733 --> 00:41:00,634
Go back to the Shadow.

299
00:41:08,534 --> 00:41:12,735
YOU - SHALL NOT - PASS!

300
00:41:40,037 --> 00:41:43,738
- No! No!
- Gandalf!

301
00:41:51,538 --> 00:41:53,939
Fly, you fools!

302
00:41:58,139 --> 00:42:00,239
No!

303
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,540
Aragorn!

304
00:43:06,045 --> 00:43:08,745
Legolas, get them up.

305
00:43:12,846 --> 00:43:14,646
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

306
00:43:14,946 --> 00:43:18,446
By nightfall, these hills will be swarming with orcs.

307
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:21,947
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.

308
00:43:23,047 --> 00:43:26,247
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

309
00:43:27,947 --> 00:43:30,047
On your feet, Sam.

310
00:43:30,447 --> 00:43:31,848
Frodo?

311
00:43:33,948 --> 00:43:35,548
Frodo!

Well, here's one dwarf she won't ensnare so easily.

328
00:45:13,957 --> 00:45:18,357
I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox.

So much for the legendary courtesy of the elves!

336
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,261
Speak words we can all understand!

337
00:45:53,261 --> 00:45:57,861
We have not had dealings with
the dwarves since the dark days.

338
00:45:58,261 --> 00:46:00,661

You bring great evil with you.

342
00:46:22,063 --> 00:46:24,163

Nor would he have you give up hope.

351
00:47:08,767 --> 00:47:11,968
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

352
00:47:13,068 --> 00:47:16,068
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

353

I can no longer see him from afar.

367
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:32,481
Gandalf the Grey did not pass

What now becomes of this fellowship?

380
00:50:43,287 --> 00:50:46,087
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

381
00:50:49,188 --> 00:50:52,388
The quest stands upon the edge of a knife.

382
00:50:52,388 --> 00:50:55,488
Stray but a little and it will fail...

504
01:02:41,353 --> 01:02:43,153
Four.

505
01:02:49,054 --> 01:02:51,554
Every league you travel south,
the danger will increase.

506
01:02:51,854 --> 01:02:55,755
Mordor orcs now hold the
eastern shore of the Anduin.

507
01:02:56,155 --> 01:02:58,555
Nor will you find safety on the western bank.

508
01:02:58,855 --> 01:03:02,555
Strange creatures bearing the mark of the
white hand have been seen on our borders.

509
01:03:02,955 --> 01:03:07,756
Seldom do orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

510
01:03:16,186 --> 01:03:18,331
[Sindarin] <i>Le aphadar aen.</i>
[English] You are being tracked.

511
01:03:20,657 --> 01:03:25,057
By river you have the chance of outrunning
the enemy to the falls of Rauros.

512
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:47,159
<i>My gift for you, Legolas, is a bow of the Galadhrim.</i>

513
01:03:47,559 --> 01:03:50,860
<i>Worthy of the skill of our woodland kin.</i>

514
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:58,860
<i>These are the daggers of the Noldorin.</i>

515
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:02,961
<i>They have already seen service in war.</i>

516
01:04:03,261 --> 01:04:05,461
<i>Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.</i>

517
01:04:05,761 --> 01:04:08,861
<i>You will find your courage.</i>

518
01:04:10,861 --> 01:04:12,862
<i>And for you, Samwise Gamgee...</i>

519
01:04:12,862 --> 01:04:15,762
<i>...Elven rope made of hithlain.</i>

520
01:04:15,762 --> 01:04:17,962
Thank you, my lady.

521
01:04:19,862 --> 01:04:23,063
Have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers?

522
01:04:29,563 --> 01:04:32,463
And what gift would a dwarf ask of the elves?

523
01:04:32,863 --> 01:04:34,964
Nothing.

524
01:04:35,664 --> 01:04:38,864
Except to look upon the lady
of the Galadhrim one last time...

525
01:04:39,564 --> 01:04:44,565
...for she is more fair than all
the jewels beneath the earth.

526
01:04:51,765 --> 01:04:53,265
Actually....

527
01:04:53,565 --> 01:04:55,166
There was one thing.

528
01:04:56,066 --> 01:04:58,566
No, no, I couldn't.
It's quite impossible.

529
01:04:58,866 --> 01:05:01,566
Stupid to ask.

530
01:05:04,266 --> 01:05:06,267
<i>I have nothing greater to give...</i>

531
01:05:06,267 --> 01:05:09,967
<i>...than the gift you already bear.</i>

532
01:05:10,670 --> 01:05:11,713
[Sindarin] <i>Am meleth dîn...</i>
[English] For her love...

533
01:05:12,989 --> 01:05:18,245
[Sindarin] <i>...I ant e guil Arwen Undómiel pígatha.</i>
[English] ...the gift of life of Arwen will fade.

534
01:05:19,396 --> 01:05:21,233
[Sindarin] <i>Aníron i e broniatha...</i>
[English] I wish that she endures...

535
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:26,279
[Sindarin] <i>...Ad ae periatham athar i methid en-amar hen.</i>
[English] ...even if we separate beyond the limits of this world.

536
01:05:28,982 --> 01:05:34,995
[Sindarin] <i>Aníron i e círatha na Valinor.</i>
[English] I wish that she sails to Valinor.

537
01:05:35,469 --> 01:05:38,369
That choice is yet before her.

538
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:42,070
You have your own choice to make, Aragorn.

539
01:05:42,470 --> 01:05:47,970
To rise above the height of all your
fathers since the days of Elendil...

540
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:52,671
...or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

541
01:05:59,756 --> 01:06:00,792
[Quenya] <i>Namárië.</i>
[English] Farewell.

542
01:06:05,071 --> 01:06:07,949
[Sindarin] <i>Nadath nâ i moe cerich...</i>
[English] There is much you have yet to do...

543
01:06:10,456 --> 01:06:11,750
[Sindarin] <i>...dan...</i>
[English] ...but...

544
01:06:14,733 --> 01:06:17,893
[Sindarin] <i>...ú-'eveditham, Elessar.</i>
[English] ...we shall not meet again, Elessar.

545
01:06:20,473 --> 01:06:23,574
<i>Farewell, Frodo Baggins.</i>

546
01:06:23,574 --> 01:06:27,074
<i>I give you the light of Earendil...</i>

547
01:06:28,074 --> 01:06:30,274
<i>...our most beloved star.</i>

548
01:06:39,475 --> 01:06:43,675
<i>May it be a light for you in dark places...</i>

549
01:06:44,076 --> 01:06:48,076
<i>... when all other lights go out.</i>

550
01:06:57,177 --> 01:07:00,177
I have taken my worst wound at this parting...

551
01:07:00,977 --> 01:07:04,977
...having looked my last upon that which is fairest.

552
01:07:05,978 --> 01:07:09,178
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

553
01:07:09,578 --> 01:07:11,478
What was her gift?

554
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:16,478
I asked her for one hair from her golden head.

555
01:07:17,379 --> 01:07:20,179
She gave me three.

556
01:09:02,488 --> 01:09:05,789
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

557
01:09:09,689 --> 01:09:12,589
I had hoped we would lose him on the river.

558
01:09:12,989 --> 01:09:15,989
But he's too clever a waterman.

559
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:20,190
And if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts...

560
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:22,490
...it will make the crossing even more dangerous.

561
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:24,790
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

562
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:28,091
- No, Sam.
- You haven't eaten anything all day.

563
01:09:28,491 --> 01:09:31,391
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

564
01:09:32,391 --> 01:09:35,291
- Mr. Frodo
- I'm all right.

565
01:09:35,591 --> 01:09:36,691
But you're not.

566
01:09:37,091 --> 01:09:39,592
I'm here to help you.

567
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:41,392
I promised Gandalf that I would.

568
01:09:47,492 --> 01:09:49,993
You can't help me, Sam.

569
01:09:52,393 --> 01:09:53,993
Not this time.

570
01:09:56,993 --> 01:09:58,993
Get some sleep.

571
01:10:05,394 --> 01:10:07,494
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

572
01:10:08,094 --> 01:10:10,695
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

573
01:10:11,495 --> 01:10:13,595
Strike out for Mordor from a place of strength.

574
01:10:13,995 --> 01:10:16,695
There is no strength in Gondor that can avail us.

575
01:10:17,395 --> 01:10:19,295
You were quick enough to trust the elves.

576
01:10:21,195 --> 01:10:23,996
Have you so little faith in your own people?

577
01:10:23,996 --> 01:10:26,996
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

578
01:10:27,396 --> 01:10:30,596
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in men.

579
01:10:30,896 --> 01:10:32,997
But you will not see that.

580
01:10:33,497 --> 01:10:34,797
You are afraid!

581
01:10:35,197 --> 01:10:37,597
All your life, you have hidden in the shadows.

582
01:10:37,997 --> 01:10:41,297
Scared of who you are, of what you are.

583
01:10:43,898 --> 01:10:48,098
I will not lead the ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

584
01:11:00,099 --> 01:11:01,399
Frodo.

585
01:11:03,299 --> 01:11:04,699
The Argonath.

591
01:12:36,108 --> 01:12:38,508
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

592
01:12:38,808 --> 01:12:42,108
- We approach Mordor from the North.
- Oh, yes?

593
01:12:42,708 --> 01:12:46,409
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

594
01:12:46,709 --> 01:12:49,809
...an impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks.

595
01:12:50,109 --> 01:12:53,109
And after that, it gets even better.

596
01:12:53,609 --> 01:12:58,310
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

597
01:12:58,810 --> 01:13:00,110
That is our road.

598
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:04,811
I suggest you take some rest and
recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

599
01:13:05,111 --> 01:13:06,711
Recover my...

600
01:13:09,911 --> 01:13:11,711
- We should Leave now.
- No.

601
01:13:12,011 --> 01:13:16,212
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

602
01:13:16,612 --> 01:13:20,012
It is not the eastern shore that worries me.

603
01:13:20,312 --> 01:13:24,112
A shadow and a threat has
been growing in my mind.

604
01:13:24,812 --> 01:13:28,813
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

605
01:13:31,013 --> 01:13:35,713
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young hobbit.

606
01:13:36,513 --> 01:13:38,114
Where's Frodo?

607
01:14:03,816 --> 01:14:05,716
None of us should wander alone.

608
01:14:07,016 --> 01:14:09,116
You, least of all.

609
01:14:09,416 --> 01:14:11,717
So much depends on you.

610
01:14:12,917 --> 01:14:14,817
Frodo?

611
01:14:22,018 --> 01:14:24,518
I know why you seek solitude.

612
01:14:25,318 --> 01:14:28,618
You suffer. I see it day by day.

613
01:14:29,518 --> 01:14:32,519
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

614
01:14:34,219 --> 01:14:36,819
There are other ways, Frodo.

615
01:14:37,119 --> 01:14:40,819
- Other paths that we might take.
- I know what you would say.

616
01:14:41,119 --> 01:14:44,720
It would seem like wisdom but
for the warning in my heart.

617
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:48,120
Warning...against what?

618
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:50,420
We're all afraid, Frodo.

619
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:54,221
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

620
01:14:54,621 --> 01:14:58,221
...don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.

621
01:15:00,221 --> 01:15:03,321
I ask only for the strength to defend my people!

622
01:15:05,122 --> 01:15:07,022
- If you would but lend me the ring.
- No.

623
01:15:08,322 --> 01:15:11,822
- Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
- You are not yourself.

624
01:15:13,922 --> 01:15:17,023
What chance do you think you have?

625
01:15:17,323 --> 01:15:21,823
They will find you.
They will take the ring.

626
01:15:22,223 --> 01:15:25,823
And you will beg for death before the end!

627
01:15:28,124 --> 01:15:30,124
You fool!

628
01:15:30,124 --> 01:15:34,224
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

629
01:15:34,524 --> 01:15:37,225
It should be mine! Give it to me!

630
01:15:37,525 --> 01:15:38,725
- Give it to me!
- No!

631
01:15:39,025 --> 01:15:40,825
- Give it to me!
- No.

632
01:15:48,526 --> 01:15:50,426
I see your mind.

633
01:15:50,826 --> 01:15:53,626
You will take the ring to Sauron!

634
01:15:53,926 --> 01:15:55,726
You will betray us!

635
01:15:56,026 --> 01:15:59,127
You'll go to your death, and the death of us all!

636
01:15:59,627 --> 01:16:03,127
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

01:20:04,749 --> 01:20:06,749
What's he doing?

672
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:12,950
He's leaving.

673
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:20,651
- No!
- Pippin!

674
01:20:25,651 --> 01:20:27,851
Run, Frodo. Go!

675
01:20:28,551 --> 01:20:31,452
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Over here!

676
01:20:32,052 --> 01:20:33,552
- Over here!
- This way!

677
01:20:44,553 --> 01:20:46,753
- It's working!
- I know it's working! Run!

678
01:21:42,158 --> 01:21:45,058
- The horn of Gondor.
- Boromir.

679
01:22:28,362 --> 01:22:29,362
Run!

680
01:26:01,082 --> 01:26:02,582
No.

681
01:26:06,682 --> 01:26:09,583
- They took the little ones.
- Hold still.

682
01:26:09,883 --> 01:26:11,883
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

683
01:26:13,883 --> 01:26:15,283
I let Frodo go.

684
01:26:15,983 --> 01:26:18,483
Then you did what I could not.

685
01:26:19,584 --> 01:26:22,784
I tried to take the ring from him.

686
01:26:23,384 --> 01:26:27,484
- The ring is beyond our reach now.
- Forgive me.

687
01:26:27,884 --> 01:26:30,085
I did not see it.

688
01:26:30,385 --> 01:26:33,485
- I have failed you all.
- No, Boromir.

689
01:26:34,085 --> 01:26:36,485
You fought bravely.

690
01:26:36,885 --> 01:26:39,385
You have kept your honor.

691
01:26:40,185 --> 01:26:41,886
Leave it.

692
01:26:42,386 --> 01:26:44,386
It is over.

693
01:26:45,686 --> 01:26:50,786
The world of men will fall and
all will come to darkness...

694
01:26:51,387 --> 01:26:54,187
...and my city to ruin.

695
01:26:58,387 --> 01:27:01,087
I do not know what strength is in my blood...

696
01:27:01,087 --> 01:27:05,188
...but I swear to you, I will
not let the white city fall...

697
01:27:06,288 --> 01:27:08,688
...nor our people fail.

698
01:27:09,688 --> 01:27:11,088
Our people.

699
01:27:14,989 --> 01:27:16,989
Our people.

700
01:27:38,791 --> 01:27:41,691
I would have followed you, my brother.

701
01:27:43,391 --> 01:27:45,291
My captain.

702
01:27:48,092 --> 01:27:49,892
My king.

703
01:28:09,594 --> 01:28:11,694
Be at peace...

704
01:28:12,294 --> 01:28:14,094
...son of Gondor.

705
01:28:30,596 --> 01:28:33,796
They will look for his coming from the white tower.

706
01:28:34,496 --> 01:28:37,396
But he will not return.

707
01:29:00,798 --> 01:29:02,699
Frodo!

708
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:25,401
<i>I wish the ring had never come to me.</i>

709
01:29:26,701 --> 01:29:29,501
<i>I wish none of this had happened.</i>

710
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:35,402
<i>So do all who live to see such times...</i>

711
01:29:35,702 --> 01:29:39,002
<i>...but that is not for them to decide.</i>

712
01:29:39,402 --> 01:29:41,902
<i>All you have to decide...</i>

713
01:29:42,202 --> 01:29:46,803
<i>...is what to do with the time that is given to you.</i>

714
01:30:15,705 --> 01:30:17,705
Frodo, no!

715
01:30:18,506 --> 01:30:19,706
Frodo!

716
01:30:20,406 --> 01:30:23,006
- Mr. Frodo!
- No, Sam.

717
01:30:26,706 --> 01:30:28,606
Go back, Sam!

718
01:30:29,207 --> 01:30:32,607
- I'm going to Mordor alone.
- Of course you are.

719
01:30:32,907 --> 01:30:35,607
And I'm coming with you!

720
01:30:36,307 --> 01:30:38,607
You can't swim!

721
01:30:42,408 --> 01:30:44,108
Sam!

722
01:30:49,708 --> 01:30:51,109
Sam!

723
01:31:32,012 --> 01:31:34,713
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

724
01:31:35,113 --> 01:31:39,213
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

725
01:31:40,513 --> 01:31:43,013
And I don't mean to.

726
01:31:43,413 --> 01:31:45,514
I don't mean to.

727
01:31:47,314 --> 01:31:49,014
Oh Sam.

728
01:32:04,015 --> 01:32:05,615
Come on.

729
01:32:34,018 --> 01:32:38,418
Hurry! Frodo and Sam have
reached the eastern shore.

730
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:58,420
- You mean not to follow them.
- Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

731
01:33:01,921 --> 01:33:06,621
Then it has all been in vain.
The fellowship has failed.

732
01:33:18,622 --> 01:33:21,722
Not if we hold true to each other.

733
01:33:23,223 --> 01:33:27,523
We will not abandon Merry and
Pippin to torment and death.

734
01:33:28,623 --> 01:33:33,724
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

735
01:33:35,224 --> 01:33:37,124
We travel light.

736
01:33:37,424 --> 01:33:39,324
Let us hunt some orc.

737
01:33:42,324 --> 01:33:44,324
Yes!

738
01:34:03,326 --> 01:34:04,726
Mordor.

739
01:34:05,426 --> 01:34:08,627
I hope the others find a safer road.

740
01:34:09,727 --> 01:34:12,227
Strider will look after them.

741
01:34:13,327 --> 01:34:16,527
I don't suppose we'll ever see them again.

742
01:34:17,027 --> 01:34:19,328
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

743
01:34:19,328 --> 01:34:21,028
We may.

744
01:34:23,228 --> 01:34:24,328
Sam...

745
01:34:27,929 --> 01:34:30,429
...I'm glad you are with me.
